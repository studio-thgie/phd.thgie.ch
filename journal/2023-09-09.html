        <p>I was on a two weeks vacation in August and didnâ€™t care much
        about my journal. Still, a lot of things continued to become and
        manifest.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Preparing <a

        <a href="https://playbern.ch/">PlayBern 2023</a></li>
        <li>Working on a blog post with Aurelia for <a
        href="notes/Confederatio%20Ludens.html">Ludens</a> on the <a
        href="notes/Bare%20Chested%20Men.html">visuality and discourse of
        violence in digital games in the 80ies</a></li>
        <li>Finished <a href="notes/Literature.html">summer readings</a>
        <ul>

        your own Adventures in Source Code</a> accepted without any
        changes ðŸ‘€ and then continued to change it slightly after my
        summer readings, updating it with what I learned. Especially
        Willumsenâ€™s text was important to include</li>
        <li>Guess I finished a first rough draft of my <a
        href="output/expose.html">expose</a>. At least it feels like all
        the parts are in place. But since itâ€™s a larger document I need
        to rework it now, remove things I repeat to often, make it more
        concise and clear and remove not relevant leftovers from the
        beginning of writing â€“Â and then discuss it!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="readings">Readings</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m happy I was able to go through Cybertext by Aarseth. Itâ€™s
        such an important piece, because he really though structurally
        on the medium, and not just about the content or reception, and
        what that makes out of the authors. But then again, Aarseth
        comes from literature studies and that is his lense, still
        today. That insight was also very important, since the book can
        bring me only that far. Iâ€™m super happy to have stumbled across
        the text by MÃ¶ring and Fizek, because they reposition the
        digital game as image, and donâ€™t only frame it on the narrative
        to ludic spectrum. In beginnings with MÃ¶ring and very strong
        with Fizek, the digital game is thought through the lenses of
        image and visual design studies. Iâ€™m super happy that Fizek even
        refers to VilÃ©m Flusser. Willumsenâ€™s text was very important
        regarding critical code analysis and hermeneutically reading
        gamesâ€™ source code. It helped me tremendously in understanding
        what kind of text source code is.</p>
        <h2 id="output">Output</h2>
        <p>I realised that I have been busy on that front as well, and
        Iâ€™m very happy with the output so far</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Collabed on a blog post for the analysis of a game</li>
        <li>Collabed on a text for a games and journalism handbook</li>
        <li>Had a contribution to a fantastic conference on
        Games&amp;Literature</li>
        <li>Will do a proceedings text for said conference</li>
        <li>Had my text on analysing <a href="notes/VICE.html">VICE</a>â€™s
        source code for a book accepted</li>
        <li>Started a collab on programming and procedural
        visuality</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="and-now">And now?</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m super happy with how everything advanced so far, so are
        my supervisors. Itâ€™s a good start and Iâ€™m sure this will help me
        get through harder phases. I just need to remember then, how it
        was now and that such a state as now is possible. The summer
        helped me solidify everything and I feel pretty safe and secure
        with the position I have right now. I love the direction my
        dissertation is taking and I believe it relevant enough, a bit
        experimental, but also doable.</p>
