        <p>The semester is turning towards it end and I’m starting to
        have more time and space to concentrate on my dissertation
        again. I have the feeling that I need to find some rythm and
        structure to work precise, concentrate and find continuity and
        patience. Sometimes researching feels like trying to find the
        needle in the hay, but there is no hay, just needles. But that’s
        for the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>I had a good talk with my colleague Pierre-Yves Hurel and
        discussed his inquire into Aventura. Some parallels to Robox
        showed up, both being early examples of amateur games. If I can
        aquire the source code of both games, the dataset for them would
        be complete. Executable game, interviews and source code is the
        bare minimum I need to test my proposed methodology for critical
        code analysis of video game graphics. I’d love to have such
        complete datasets for some amateur games, some professional
        developed ones and some stuff in between, like Robox or Ball
        Raider. Like that I could look at a variety of games that were
        made in the 80ies and 90ies in the shift from amateur to
        professional game development.</p>
