        2023, accuracy in visuality and the OpenRefine-Wikidata
        combo</h1>
        <p>As the title implies this will be a larger entry. I’d love to
        briefly cover my participation at the DHCH 2023, the summer
        school/conference of the Swiss Digital Humanities. While
        researching emulators and old video games, I also came across an
        interesting case that could pinpoint to games I’d surely want to
        research. Finally, I also want to note down some of my
        experiences with working with OpenRefine for the task of
        importing things to Wikidata. That last point might expand into
        its own note at a point.</p>
        <h2 id="dhch-2023">DHCH 2023</h2>
        <p>I experienced this year’s DHCH much calmer than last year.
        Probably I was less nervous and the energy was all overall less
        chaotic and excited<a href="/journal/2023-06-16.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. This year the
        PhD students did lightning talks as well as a student-to-student
        workshop in a world-cafe format. I like both very much. Here are
        my notes for my presentation.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="output/dhch_2023/dhch_2023_expose.html">DHCH 2023
        Expose</a></li>

        2023 Presentation Notes</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regarding the workshop, I presented emulators as a crucial
        but under-researched tool in the research on video games. I was
        able to show the problems regarding that piece of software, and
        then we played some games, of course, under the guise of
        research!</p>
        <p>I could also participate in a master student’s thesis
        presentation from in the DH at the University of Bern. He worked
        on a rather large corpus of letters and used Transkribus, Voyant
        Tools and Mallet to gain insights via distant reading. The
        presentation was very good and gave me a valuable insight into
        why my own attempt with <a
        href="notes/Distant%20Reading%20the%20VICE%20Source%20Code.html">Distant
        Reading the VICE Source Code</a> results into a scrambled mess.
        That insight can be found under <a
        href="notes/Source%20Code%20as%20Text.html">Source Code as
        Text</a>, and circles around the ability to sort a corpus, which
        is tough with sourcecode.</p>
        <p>Source code is a highly networked text, modularised, and
        references other pieces of itself all the time. This realisation
        gave me the idea to attempt to visualise this network of a
        text.</p>
        <h2 id="accuracy-in-the-visuality-in-video-games">Accuracy in
        the visuality in video games</h2>
        <p>One of the main tenets in historical research is a need for
        accuracy. In order to study things of the past, we don’t want to
        have mere sketches of it, we want to be able to have a good and
        detailed look at its original form. One of the main tenets in
        video games research is, that one has to play the games in order
        to be able to look at them properly.</p>
        <p>The problem arises when these two intersect and we want to
        study old games, and we don’t have access to the original gaming
        systems anymore. Then, the need for emulation comes up.
        Emulation is a best-effort approach to enable access to video
        games of the past. They can’t duplicate the original system in
        it’s entirety and must make sacrifices in places. For example,
        if the emulation of a graphic chip takes to much resources,
        hacks and solutions are found to bypass this restriction.
        Running something is more important than running it
        accurately.</p>
        <p>Generally then, emulation is viewed as flawed in representing
        the past accurately, but accepted as the only solution for this
        approach.</p>
        <p>Now, for a while in the 80ies and 90ies, many of the more
        popular and successful video games were ported to to different
        systems with wildly different graphic capabilities<a href="/journal/2023-06-16.html#fn2"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. I came across this while
        research on the topic of representation of masculinity in games.
        Two great examples are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6739/ikari-warriors/screenshots/">Ikari
        Warriors</a></li>
        <li><a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/12167/axe-of-rage/screenshots/">Barbarian
        II/Axe of Rage</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I can’t formulate my thoughts clearly yet. But there seems to
        be an interesting tension between the aforementioned problem and
        design rhetorics, respectively the intention and affects/effects
        of the designers of the games. Luckily we have some games
        fitting this profile in our corpus:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/4134/rolling-ronny/screenshots/">Rolling
        Rolly</a></li>
        <li><a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/528/the-neverending-story-ii-the-arcade-game/screenshots/">The
        Neverending Story II</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because of this tension, I’m super interested in looking at
        the game code of these two and how this different expressions of
        visuality with the same intentions manifested there.</p>
