# VICE and Voyant Tools
I talked with [Moritz Mähr](https://moritzmaehr.ch/) about how to approach treating a code base as a text corpus, and he recommended to give Voyant Tools a shot. So, here we go: [Distant Reading the VICE Source Code](notes/Distant%20Reading%20the%20VICE%20Source%20Code.md). In this inquiry, I'm trying my hands at text-mining the source code of a Commodore 64 emulator. I chose this repository because the source code is rich in comments and because I can use the results of my research for an article in an upcoming book.
