        <p>As expected, the study semester is taking a toll on time,
        energy and focus. It seems easier, and more relevant, than last
        semester. Especially a course at the Université de Lausanne
        (UNIL) gives me plenty of chances to elaborate, collaborate and
        exchange on topics regarding my dissertation and video game
        studies in general. The UNIL has a joint <a
        href="https://gamelab-lausanne.ch/">GameLab</a> together with
        the EPFL, and they are established and experienced. The course
        I’m visiting is given by our team in Lausanne, Yannick Rochat,
        Pierre-Yves Hurel and Sophie Bémelmans, and is called “#
        Histoire et préservation du jeu vidéo : état des lieux en
        Suisse”.</p>
        <p>Last week I was invited to speak about team Bern’s analysis
        of <a href="games/Ball%20Raider.html">Ball Raider</a> (1987) and
        the approached we had, the [[Horror Game Politics]] methodology.
        The slides can be found via <a
        href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10023302"><img
        src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10023302.svg"
        alt="DOI" /></a>, and are in French. <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231023121857/https://hcommons.social/@chludens/111283605342804826">Here
        is a Mastodon post</a> on my lecture. It was actually quite fun,
        and I’m happy to practice my academic French.</p>
        <p>Besides that, I feel that the productivity from the summer
        came to a halt. There are probably two reasons. One, I’m doing
        more collaborative things now, and those just feel different.
        Two, I’m done with my exposé (more or less) and the necessary
        pre-case studies. There is just not much reading, researching or
        writing that I do only for my dissertation, and hence, not a
        feeling of advancing much for my own project. I’m looking
        forward to next year, when I’ll be able to get dead bored doing
        actual research and working on Excel sheets and ontologies for
        month on end :)</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, things are happening. I feel ready with my
        exposé so far. If it is seen as a rough guide for the next three
        years. This week I’ll be able to discuss it with the design
        research people. I have no clue if I can communicate them my
        intent. Their opinion will be valuable nonetheless. I also was
        able to work on three posts for the Ludens blog. One is already
        published and on working academically with <a
        href="notes/Amiga.html">Amiga</a> floppies. I’m discussing a bit
        my experience and thoughts of working with <a
        href="notes/Greaseweazle.html">Greaseweazle</a> and
        dumping/writing floppies. Here is an archived version of the
        post: <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231023130410/https://chludens.hypotheses.org/893">Working
        with Amiga Floppy Disks in Historical Video Game Research –
        Confoederatio Ludens</a>. The second one is a review of the
        Games&amp;Literature conference in Marbach and should be
        published soonish.</p>
        <p>The last of the three posts is a bigger article on
        hypermasculinity and violence in 1980s’ video games. I
        collaborated with Aurelia Brandenburg on that text, and I liked
        a lot working with her on that subject. I was able to gain some
        insights into her methodology, which is valuable for me. But I
        will discuss it once it’s through our internal review and
        published. We plan to use the post as a base for a lecture we
        two give for the lecture series here in the digital humanities
        at the University of Berne.</p>
        <p>I haven’t advanced too much in the direction of design
        research and video games. But, I’ve been given the chance to
        write a review of Björn Blankenheim’s book <a
        href="https://www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-4834-8/die-kunst-des-computer-game-design/">Die
        Kunst des Computer Game Design</a>. I had the chance to briefly
        chat with him in Marbach, but didn’t know of his book back then.
        I hope it will give me some insights into this topic. I was also
        asked by my exchange colleague Tao Fan to write a summary of our
        research project from the perspective of the digital humanities.
        It will be published in a Chinese journal, and he’ll provide a
        translation of the text. I’m looking forward to writing that
        text, since it will serve as a good chance to reflect on the
        project and my approach to it.</p>
