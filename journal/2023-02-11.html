        <p>I took part in the online-workshop: Images in Social Media
        Research<a href="/journal/2023-02-11.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. It was structured through
        brief 15-20 minute-long inputs by various researchers. The topic
        hovered around digital methodologies derived from content and
        cultural analysis.</p>
        <p><img
        src="assets/1ffda7b0-d242-4693-bcb7-9b0900b65376.png" /></p>
        <p>Being new-ish to digital visual studies, I was mainly
        interested in the practical approaches, the methods and
        methodologies, as well as the tools in use. The first panel as
        well as partially the second panel were truly giving in that
        regard. Starting with Lev Manovich’s input, the workshop drifted
        into areas I couldn’t directly relate to and as such had a
        difficult time following at times.</p>
        <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
        <p>Some of the fantastic tools and initiatives presented:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="https://tools.digitalmethods.net/netvizz/youtube/">YouTube
        Data Tools</a>: Query and scrape YouTube for metadata</li>
        <li><a href="https://4cat.nl/">4CAT</a>: Querying and scraping a
        range of text-based social media platforms. 4CAT also offers
        amazing analysis tools to work with the scraped data</li>
        <li><a
        href="https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer">zeeschuimer</a>:
        A Firefox extension that can scrape Instagram, which can then be
        worked on through 4CAT</li>
        <li><a
        href="https://github.com/jason-chao/memespector-gui">Memespector-GUI</a>:
        The 3rd iteration of the memespector, enabling the researcher to
        analyse visual material through computer vision APIs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="methods-and-methodologies">Methods and
        methodologies</h2>
        <p>I was particularly taken by an input by <a
        href="http://www.niederer.info/">Sabine Niederer</a>. She
        demonstrated her/their approach through a few projects of the <a
        href="https://visualmethodologies.org/">Visual Methodologies
        Collective</a>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Zooming out: Using computational aids and methods, such as
        content analysis and software, to look for rhythm and patterns
        and gaining an overview</li>
        <li>Zooming in: ethnographic and close reading approaches to
        look at specific cases that verify a thesis or demonstrate
        something in particular. From my point of view, semiology,
        discourse analysis or ethnographic methods fit here</li>
        <li>Opening up: Working in image research in a participatory and
        collaboratively manner, such as involving affected
        communities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another interesting input, although a bit fuzzy and not
        reflected in parts, was by <a
        href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2955-5926">Elena Pilipets</a>.
        She worked on analysing #deeptook. Besides being an
        organizational unit, a hashtag, #deeptok is also a sub-community
        on TikTok, boasting itself through being especially edgy.
        Through the presentation, she indicated problems and weaknesses
        that different computational approaches have, such as using
        Google Video AI. She also presented an approach how to research
        <a href="https://www.centreforthestudyof.net/">networked
        images</a>, the corner-points being accessible in her
        presentation slides<a href="/journal/2023-02-11.html#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, which I
        preserved here on <a
        href="https://archive.org/details/deep-tiktok-video-memes">archive.org</a>.</p>
        <p><img

        <h2 id="afterthought">Afterthought</h2>
        <p>What did I learn? Well, networked images are a thing. The
        constitution of visual material today is way more fluid than
        say, 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>I got massively inspired to experiment with some of the tools
        presented. I could imagine, for example, to scrape social media
        for contemporary visual material on the games we’re researching.
        As a quick test, I found a bunch of videos on YouTube on the
        topic of [[Ball Raider]], grabbed their metadata and visualized
        their accompanied keywords in Gephi.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="assets/ball_raider.png" alt="ball_raider" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">ball_raider</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Looks pretty, doesn’t answer any questions. It would be
        interesting to use the metadata and work through the videos with
        Memespector to see in what kind of contexts the videos are
        shown.</p>
        <p>A point that came up over and over again, was the
        interconnection between social media image research and platform
        research. Those two are inextricably linked. All social media
        today is corporate media, and they decide the access researchers
        can have. They decide, what data goes out. As such, understand
        the <em>affordances</em> of the platform you are targeting is
        paramount. Studying the content of a platform is also studying
        the platform.</p>
        <p>I didn’t follow the ethics part too closely, but I guess <a
        href="https://www.forskningsetikk.no/en/guidelines/social-sciences-humanities-law-and-theology/a-guide-to-internet-research-ethics/">this
        guide to internet research ethics</a> is an important read.</p>
