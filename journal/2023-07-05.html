        <h1 id="looking-back-at-the-games-literature-conference">Looking
        back at the Games &amp; Literature Conference</h1>
        <p>The Games &amp; Literature conference at the German
        Literature Archive in Marbach was intense. I counted 30 talks on
        the program, from which I attended 25 and gave one together with
        Eugen Pfister. The subtitle of the conference was <strong>On the
        Literacy, Research, Collection, and Archiving of Computer
        Games</strong>, and the panels were organized accordingly.</p>
        <p>I was very taken by the generosity and cordiality during the
        days in Marbach. I was being invited to peoples‚Äô home, had
        plenty of discussions, touching moments and met many new people
        ‚Äì¬†all of them really, really wonderful and kind. I‚Äôm not sure to
        what this can be attributed to, but I‚Äôm happy about it. Despite
        everything and everyone was on a high professional level, there
        was not a hint of competition. The research community present
        made me feel being a part of it quickly. And I cherished that
        feeling. Nonetheless, after three days of conference I was
        exhausted, but so was everybody else.</p>
        <p>The conference encompassed so many different perspectives,
        that it is quite difficult to sort it out in a meaningful
        manner. I wasn‚Äôt particularly taken by the discourse on how
        digital games are literature. That‚Äôs not my corner. The most
        valuable insights for me came through contributions on to how to
        analyse digital games, or, <em>reading</em> them. An interesting
        insight was, at least for me, that all the different approaches
        always focused on the playable game. A handful of contributions
        worked with paratextual material, for example Manuel Burghardt‚Äôs
        distant viewing of game trailers or Mario Gomes contextual
        reading of Colossal Cave Adventure. None of them looked at the
        technological side of digital games, at last not from a
        practical perspective. Next to Espen Aarseth‚Äôs closing keynote,
        only Hans-Joachim Backe‚Äôs went into the procedurality of games,
        at least touching the medial specifics of them.</p>
        <p>The important question for me then would be, how important is
        a digital game‚Äôs source code for its analysis? Respectively,
        <strong>what kind of knowledge can the analysis of digital games
        source code generate and add to the discourse?</strong></p>
        <p>The materiality of games and their production, as in
        hardware, software and paratexts, was a significant aspect
        concerning collecting and archiving. Several contributions went
        into the problematics of long term archiving digital games. From
        collecting material that is generated during design and
        production to archiving games that don‚Äôt come on physical
        storage media, everybody seems struggling and trying their best.
        The keynote by Ren√© Bauer and Beat Suter went into this, as well
        as contributions by Csongor Baranyai and Joy DuBose. I sadly
        missed the latter.</p>
        <p>Another important aspect were the catalogues and metadata of
        such archives, where I can also place the contribution of Eugen
        Pfister and myself. Archives are invaluable, but even better if
        accessible. Metadata and search interfaces help with that, a
        lot. I was genuinely interested in the contribution of Tobias
        Wildi, who went into Records in Context, a new standard for
        structuring metadata. He will join a lecture series this fall at
        the University of Bern and I‚Äôm looking forward to more exchange
        on this topic. Likewise, I was also more than happy to attend
        Michelle Goodridge‚Äôs talk on accessibility and diversity in
        games from a librarian‚Äôs point of view.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, I wasn‚Äôt very sure if our own contribution
        would be interested enough. We had the first slot on the last
        day and I assumed people will be tired. Feedback said otherwise.
        We got more questions than time allowed to answer, and that is a
        wonderful compliment. The questions were not regarding things
        people didn‚Äôt understand, but because they wanted to know more.
        I believe that Eugen and I were able to give a lively
        presentation and insights into <strong>Why we thought it was a
        good idea to build a DACH<a href="/journal/2023-07-05.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> games
        database</strong>. The contribution was loosely based on a text
        that we‚Äôve written together with Aurelia Brandenburg and Lukas
        Daniel Klausner. It‚Äôs about a giant spreadsheet with hundreds of
        entries on digital games from the German-speaking countries.
        More on the ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù can be found under <a
        href="https://spielkult.hypotheses.org/3999">Historische
        DACH-Spieledatenbank</a>. The slides can be found under <a
        href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8103375"><img
        src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8103375.svg"
        alt="DOI" /></a> and the German Literature Archive is planning
        some kind of proceedings. I‚Äôll post if I know more on that.</p>
        <p>Looking back at this brief and intense moment, I believe it
        was a beautiful way of starting my conference life. I didn‚Äôt
        expect to make friends and professional connections and become
        part of an interesting community, and certainly not in this
        scope üíñ I‚Äôve got much love for the people in video game
        studies. Thanks for taking me in.</p>
