        September 2022</h1>
        <p><em>Adrian Demleitner</em></p>
        <p>I am particularly interested in the indie video-game scene<a
        href="/journal/2022-09-24.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and especially in video
        games as a creative medium. From a design perspective, the
        production of indie-games entails interesting aspects. Similar
        to self-publishing in graphic design, the creators of
        indie-games need to develop what Harry Collins calls
        interactional expertise (Collins, 2004). The concept describes
        the ability to converse in multiple disciplines and is closely
        connected to the concept of trading zones<a href="/journal/2022-09-24.html#fn2"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>Instead of being able to focus on one discipline, as would be
        the norm in medium to large-scale projects, indie-game
        developers need not only to consider different types of skills,
        but also different kinds of epistemologies. Coding lives in its
        own space of knowledge, compared to graphic design, and vice
        versa. These in turn can be considered hard skills, whereas
        publishing and advertisement are more on the side of soft
        skills. The different design-related disciplines, such as
        graphics, audio, interaction, narration, but also publishing,
        coding and others, all entail their own tool-chains and
        workflows.</p>
        <p>As a design practice, this is an interesting case that I’d
        like to have a closer look at. That said, currently I’m unsure
        what the specific questions could be. I believe that the current
        outline of the PhD position and setup of the research project,
        with its different subprojects, would allow for an interesting
        inquiry. Starting at the history of visual design, then making
        connections to related disciplines and media opens into a view
        on multidisciplinary practices and interactional expertises. I
        could imagine, that this trajectory would enable me to make a
        comparison between video game designers of the early days and
        today.</p>
        <p>Basically, I would like to focus on the multidisciplinary
        design practice of solo or small-team video game creators. I
        also see a potential in furthering the development of the HGP
        method by integrating such an approach. The disciplinarity
        framework (McComb &amp; Jablokow, 2022) might be of value.</p>
        <p>Method-wise I usually lean towards ethnography, and I’m often
        interested to make inquiries into infrastructures and practices
        and the interplay of these two aspects.</p>
