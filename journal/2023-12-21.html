        semester and work package 0</h1>
        <p>I mostly forgot to log this weeks works, but it’s ok, I
        guess. Next to having the last sessions of two university
        courses, I was mainly focusing on one of the deliverables. For
        the course “Histoire et préservation du jeu vidéo : état des
        lieux en Suisse” I had to do an analysis of a Swiss game. The
        vantage point was a question: What are early examples of Swiss
        games that make or work as political statements? After some
        research and combing the internet I stumbled across Minarett
        Attack, an Islamophobic Flash game from 2009. The game was
        launched as part of the Anti-Minarett campaign of the extrem
        right in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>The analysis of the game went into a post, that will be
        published on the <a
        href="https://jeulausanne.hypotheses.org/">Jeu UNIL/EPFL</a>
        blog. You can read the draft of the text here: <a
        href="notes/hist_jeu_unil_2023/hist_jeu_unil_2023_text.html">Minarett
        Attack - A video game as rhetoric device in the political
        communication of the extreme right</a>. The Islamophobic
        Minarett Attack wasn’t my first choice. It certainly is not a
        video game I’m enjoying. But, after an initial analysis, I knew
        that contextualising and discussing the game was relevant.</p>
        <p>Every now and then I reflect(ed) on the relevance of my PhD
        or doing research in video game studies. I’m in a very
        privileged position. I’m not getting rich, but I’m getting by
        without having to downgrade my lifestyle. It feels like having a
        paid residency for four years. Of course I feel the need and
        pressure to be and do something of relevance for society at
        large. Being able/enabled to do a critical analysis on racist or
        sexist<a href="/journal/2023-12-21.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> games seem to be a step into
        the right direction. Contextualising these games, critically
        research them feels right and important. But that’s only part of
        it. This kind of knowledge also has to find it’s way into
        practice. That’s not my strength at the moment and I need to
        find some collaborations in order to be more active regarding
        this.</p>
        <p>Another milestone reached is the final discussion and
        approval of my <a href="notes/expose.html">exposé</a>. My primary
        supervisor gave me a great input regarding the desired and
        targeted output and papers and I’m essentially ready to roll
        now. This marks the successful end of working package 0. In the
        following year, the exposé will mutate into a living document,
        that documents my dissertation project and will become the basis
        of the synopsis that accompanies my final thesis.</p>
        <p>I’m looking forward to next year. Free of the need to attend
        courses, I can finally concentrate fully on the research project
        as well as my dissertation. I started with some rough planning
        on what to do when, and the year will start with a lot of
        diligent labour assembling my corpora. Nice ✨</p>
