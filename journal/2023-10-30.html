        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Colloquium Feedback on
        Exposé</h1>
        <p>I had the chance to discuss my <a
        href="notes/expose.html">exposé</a> within the context of the IDR
        colloquium, which is a format where all PhD students of the
        institute can hand in their things. Since I had plenty of
        opportunities to discuss my project with people from the digital
        humanities and video games studies, I needed to have feedback
        from the design research crowd. In the following, I clustered
        some takeaways from the session.</p>
        <h2 id="cumulative-dissertation">Cumulative dissertation</h2>
        <p>A generally vague problem is my dissertation style, which
        takes form through four peer-reviewed journal-papers and a
        synopsis, which should contextualize them. Since this form leads
        to an upside-down research agenda, planning is different and not
        so many people around me have a lot of experience with it.</p>
        <p>A nice analogy that was applied is the shift from a map to a
        pathway. Instead of drawing out a map that is to be traversed
        later, a cumulative dissertation is more like drawing a pathway
        through territory to be reflected after, something that unfolds
        with each step. Somebody also mentioned going about it like a
        detective story, where I go for clues in all the un-inquired
        corners.</p>
        <p>There is also the danger of overloading the dissertation with
        too much to do, since each paper can stand on its own and has
        its own research agenda. I was warned that I have already like
        three or four mini-dissertation crammed into this one. I’ll take
        that to heart and will redo my working packages accordingly.</p>
        <h2 id="general-direction">General direction</h2>
        <p>The overall approach of looking into the materiality of video
        game graphics as well as how designing and coding graphics
        relate to each other was understood by the people present at the
        colloquium. That made me pleased, because I didn’t know if I’m
        leaning too far out into the tech sphere. Means, I’ll stick with
        my subject.</p>
        <p>The former point of overloading the dissertation applies here
        as well. I need to simplify my research question as well as the
        research gap. I could, as was proposed, simply state that the
        aesthetics and effects of video game graphics have not been
        thoroughly researched in regard to their relation to code. That
        would be the gap and question in one and could then be detailed
        in the four papers. Will be considered in the next exposé
        revision.</p>
        <p>A question that I liked a lot and will take with was about
        where my crowd is. Who are the people who I share with, whom I
        create knowledge for? This one should actually be obvious, as it
        is one of the important questions for everything we create. But,
        sometimes it is easy to lose track of it.</p>
        <p>A brief discussion revolved around the concept of
        techno-historic limits. Another feedback added that it is also
        important to look into code regarding means and relations, in
        the direction of a Marxist analysis. Then also looking into, how
        these power relations relate to aesthetics. What was formative
        for the aesthetic discourse (see for example the prevalence of
        shiny balls everywhere, since they were now easy to make)? This
        would add the dimension of power and politics, which I liked and
        will consider.</p>
        <p>Also, once again, the description of the <a
        href="notes/Translation%20of%20code%20into%20graphics.html">translation
        of code into graphics</a> was pointed out to be beautiful,
        almost poetic. I still would love to make a kind of mapping of
        the whole process, from code and hardware to physics and the
        screen, ending with the visible image. Something similar to <a
        href="https://anatomyof.ai/">Anatomy of an AI System</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="formal-elements-and-design-rhetoric">Formal elements and
        design rhetoric</h2>
        <p>In terms of rhetoric, especially, I got mainly feedback on
        staying close to the material at hand and approaching it by its
        formal aspects. A thing I noted down for myself is to have a
        good look at graphic modi, as this is a specific video game
        graphics thing from the 80ies. It would be interesting and
        important to look into those and how they were formative.</p>
        <p>I’m not sure whether I see much meaning yet in doing a
        full-blown design rhetoric analysis yet. I definitely have to
        into more formal aspects through an Auslegeordnung™️. An
        interesting comparison was made between how printing colours
        were more expensive, which led to the experimentation of what is
        possible with just two of them. In the 80s, the stylistic means
        for video game graphics were equally limited, leading to the
        abuse of graphics modi, or other kinds of experimentations. So,
        what were these style-forming processes and elements in this
        tension between limitation and enabling.</p>
        <h2 id="practical-advice">Practical advice</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Stay in practice and don’t overthink things or make them
        overtly theoretical. Ergodicity or operational image might be
        fancy concepts, but they also bring their own baggage with
        them.</li>
        <li>Check regularly when the corpus has been saturated. Do I
        have enough samples, or already too much?</li>
        <li>Reflect also on the things that are lost in the process.
        What are the dimensions of a video game image I can research,
        which ones are lost?</li>
        <li>Criteria for corpus generation or models for analysis are
        allowed to develop over the course of the dissertation.</li>
        <li>Look at ports of the “same” game for different systems. I
        already noted this one down somewhere, as an interesting case
        study regarding the authenticity debate.</li>
        <li>Take care of not naturalizing technology as the one defining
        factor for how things are. Be open to other interpretations from
        sociology, politics, and other disciplines, which are closer to
        people.</li>
        </ul>
