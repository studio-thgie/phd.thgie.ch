        <h1 id="its-summer-time-readings-corpora-and-other-updates">It’s
        summer-time: readings, corpora and other updates</h1>
        <p>It’s summer and I can finally concentrate on all things
        related to my dissertation project. On the agenda is playing
        video games, working on a <em>representation of masculinity in
        old games’</em> subproject, working on my <a
        href="notes/Image%20Corpus.html">Image Corpus</a>, and, of course,
        getting some reading is done. The reading is insofar important
        as next semester, from the middle of September to the end of
        December, I’ll be busy with course work.</p>
        <p>On my reading list I have some essentials, like Espen
        Aarseth’ Cybertext and Mark Marino’s Critical code studies, but
        also some shorter texts regarding digital games, their
        visuality, their materiality and meaning-making. I started
        reading Cybertext last week, and I am pleased to get my mind
        finally on it.</p>
        <p>Cybertext is such a loaded concept in game studies, and it’s
        really worth going into all the details and thoughts that the
        author put into it. This is not the moment to write about the
        book – I’m halfway through and already have so many notes and
        thoughts of my own… So another post on that topic will
        follow.</p>
        <h2 id="update-on-image-corpus">Update on <a
        href="notes/Image%20Corpus.html">Image Corpus</a></h2>
        <p>I worked on my image corpus. The thoughts that went into it
        can be followed by reading through the note on <a
        href="notes/Image%20Corpus.html">Image Corpus</a>. An important
        aspect I’ve done these days was to start building an ontology,
        which I can use in Tropy. I’ve contacted the people behind the
        <a href="notes/Game%20FAVR.html">Game FAVR</a> model and asked for
        review or feedback. I hope they can help me regarding the model.
        After that, I plan to communicate this work as a pre-release to
        get feedback on the ontology itself. I already started working
        with in Tropy and it’s quite handy.</p>
        <h2 id="update-on-research-question">Update on research
        question</h2>
        <p>After considering a few points in last talk with my
        supervisor as well as the conference on <a
        href="journal/2023-07-05.html">Games &amp; Literature in
        Marbach</a>, I decided to centre on the complexity of ascribing
        nationality to digital games. The focus on the materiality of
        the visuality in digital games will move into the methodological
        part as one of the approaches within discourse analysis. I
        haven’t spoken to my supervisors about this decision yet, but I
        believe it’s meaningful. I wrote an updated <a
        href="notes/Abstract.html">Abstract</a> that goes into that
        direction. More work is needed to flesh out this approach and
        work it into the expose.</p>
        <h2 id="update-on-ceegs-2023">Update on CEEGS 2023</h2>
        <p>My proposal for a contribution for the <a
        href="https://www.macromedia-fachhochschule.de/de/lp/ceegs-2023/">CEEGS
        this year</a> got rejected. You can read my application filed
        under <a href="output/ceegs_2023/ceegs_2023.html">Source code,
        visuality, and power structures: A critical reading of video
        games’ code to image transformation</a>. The reviews were fair
        and very constructive, and I’ll incorporate their main points
        into developing my expose.</p>
