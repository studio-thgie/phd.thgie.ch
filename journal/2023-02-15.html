        <p><img src="assets/Screenshot_2023-02-15_Emulation.jpeg" /></p>
        <p>The last two weeks I was playing a few video games by <a
        href="actants/Golden%20Gate%20Crew.html">Golden Gate Crew</a> as
        well as <a href="actants/Linel.html">Linel</a>. They were all
        developed and published for the Amiga system. In order to play
        them, I had to work with an emulator. I tested two
        applications:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="https://dirkwhoffmann.github.io/vAmiga/index.html">vAmiga</a>,
        which is only for macOS</li>
        <li><a href="https://fs-uae.net/">fs-uae</a>, which is a more
        extensive project</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both worked pretty well, but I stick with fs-uae for the
        moment. It seems to have a bigger community. Running the games
        is effortless. The only thing that needed a bit of work was
        finding the correct <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstart_(Amiga)">Amiga
        Kickstart ROM</a> as well fiddling with the config settings.
        Playing the games is really a blast from the past, and I had to
        laugh out loud in some moments. The graphics, the sounds…</p>
        <p>The emulator tries to stay close to the original experience,
        making the sounds that the floppy disk reader did back then, and
        sometimes taking ages to load!</p>
        <p>Although foggy currently, the act of emulation is inspiring
        some thoughts. An emulator does provide the ability to play a
        video game. Seen from the perspective of research on the visual
        material of retro video games, this is essential. <em>The
        image</em> of video games does only exist in its rawest form at
        the moment of play, the moment of <a
        href="notes/Ergodic%20Animage.html">Ergodic Animage</a>. Of
        course, we can make screenshots or recordings, but it’s a
        different image then. The image of video games always contains
        the possibility to fork into different futures. It’s a bit like
        a <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse">wave
        function collapse</a> in quantum theory. The moment we observe
        the game from the outside through screenshots and -recordings,
        the image of the video game is frozen in time and becomes a
        different kind of image.</p>
