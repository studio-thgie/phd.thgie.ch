        and visual methodologies</h1>
        <p>Since I am the graphics-person, I’m also collecting images,
        of course. I try to do as many screenshots as necessary and
        scrape the internet for additional material. There is a lot of
        <a href="notes/Paratext.html">paratext</a> laying around, such as
        box art, magazin articles, illustrations and so on. This
        collection will sooner or later lead to a corpus of it’s own. My
        personal research archive, through which I do my visual
        analysis.</p>
        <p>I started to use <a href="https://www.tropy.org/">Tropy</a>,
        an image application for <em>archival research</em>. It’s pretty
        easy to use, stable, and local first. It has a community and is
        made by the people who are also involved in Zotero and Omeka. So
        it won my heart pretty quickly. It enables me to build up my own
        ontology and describe my images as well as use tags and
        annotations.</p>
        <p><img

        <p>Once in Tropy and slightly organised, I sometimes work a bit
        more freely in <a href="https://miro.com/">Miro</a>. As an
        example I did a FAVR analysis and also tried to track some
        pop-cultural references.</p>

        <p><img src="assets/Ball%20Raider%20-%20Reference%20Mapping.jpg"
        alt="Pop-cultural references in Ball Raider" /> See board under
        https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPl1g45g=/?share_link_id=836116968145</p>
        <p>This week, I also tried to apply some computer vision/machine
        learning to the <a href="games/Ball%20Raider.html">Ball Raider</a>
        collection. Through the <a href="journal/2023-02-11.html">Images
        in Social Media Research</a> conference, I got to know <a
        href="https://github.com/jason-chao/memespector-gui">Memespector-GUI</a>,
        which is an interface to feed image-material into different
        computer vision APIs and get the result as <code>csv</code> and
        <code>json</code>. I don’t know much about the open-source
        models yet, so their results were meagre. The Google Vision API
        result was pretty fine on the other hand. Have a look at the <a
        href="assets/cv-apis-20230310_141235.csv">Ball Raider Google
        Vision and VGG16 results</a>. Here are some keywords for the
        main character of <a href="games/Ball%20Raider.html">Ball
        Raider</a>.</p>
        <pre><code>Bodybuilder; Human body; Chest; Bodybuilding; Human anatomy; Nerve; Art; Font; Trunk; Abdomen</code></pre>
        <p>My corpus will grow, and I’d love to learn more on how
        approaches in the digital humanities can support me in my
        research. I could imagine that the corpus itself will become a
        scientific output of my research.</p>
