# 28th Feb 2023 - Dissertation Contemplation
As a preparation with a first dissertation meeting with my supervisor I note my expectations, thoughts and questions here.

## Contemplation
### My expectations towards the research project

### How can my supervisor support me?

### Direction of my dissertation
Within the research group I'm part of, I hold two positions:

1. PhD student with an independent dissertation
2. PhD researcher on *History of Visual Design of Early Swiss Video Games*, defined as such

> The aim of this dissertation project is a historiography of graphic design in the games developed in Switzerland during the observed period. By focusing on the visual rhetoric and the iconography of the games, (trans)national historical continuities and transmedial influences are to be elaborated on the one hand. The aim is to create a critical catalogue of visual design that enables us to recognize connections and discrepancies. But the aim is also to work out the creative means that determine design. The loading screen of the text adventure game ZuÌˆri (1992), for example, is oriented quite closely to the motif of the tourist city panorama, while the construction game Traders (1991) uses a comic style that is rather unusual for the genre. To what extent can local influences be identified in the graphic style, interface but also in the packaging and advertising in computer journals?

The goals for the researching position would be:

> 1. A database will be created with images from the game but also from the paratexts (box, advertisement, etc).
> 2. These images will then be analyzed with the tools of Rhetorical Design Analysis and compared to other dominant graphical sources in Swiss popular culture.

My own position as PhD student is somewhere at the intersection of

- Digital Humanities (especially with my background in software development)
- Design Research (research style and methodologies through my former studies)
- Video Game Studies

## Questions
- Database: general questions about the who and where and what?
- How much liberties do I have in my own dissertation in regards to the researching position?
