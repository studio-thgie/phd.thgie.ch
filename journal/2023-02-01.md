# 1st Feb 2023
Starting December 2022, I began with my [Literature Review](Literature%20Review.md). Being only vaguely familiar with analyzing video games, that was an obvious way to start. Also, not knowing which direction my thesis will take, I'm currently focusing on the intersection of video game analysis, visual cultures and technology. I label this intersection *the materiality of video games' visual cultures*. In my MA, we were focused on engaging with problems with a social relevance. Since [Confederatio Ludens](notes/Confederatio%20Ludens.md) has a historical approach, I'm a bit at a loss here. But I'm also confident, that engaging with the corpus and the literature will bring much clarity. I also have eleven months to prepare a document, describing and outlining my thesis.
