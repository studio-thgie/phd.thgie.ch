        href="games/Necronom.html">Necronom</a> and visual layouts as
        methodology</h1>
        <p>Some notes on a first round of doing a formal analysis (<a
        href="notes/Auslegeordnung.html">Auslegeordnung</a>) on <a
        href="games/Necronom.html">Necronom</a>.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Colors are generally muted, and a lot of black is applied.
        We have a larger brownish cluster, a blue and a greenish one,
        and pink seems to be reserved for the last level and the final
        boss (and the intro).</li>
        <li>We counted 10 different font styles! This might be, because
        different people worked on different parts of the “design”
        (intro, ui, outro, levels, etc). Some of the typo seemed fitting
        for the purpose, some of it just tried to apply a weird
        style.</li>
        <li>Some level designs and arrangements create pleasing visual
        complexity, while others seem overly constructed in order to
        create difficult levels. Most levels go with little background
        action, maybe a handful of stars. Some have patterns present,
        but it seems repetitive, only one breaks with the pattern in the
        background, leaving it appear only in pieces, to create
        something visually interesting.</li>
        <li>A few phallic elements can be observed, but all over all,
        for leaning onto Giger, very little sexualised graphics are
        present (maybe that weird alien egg boss).</li>
        <li>Very little “technology” is present, except for the ship
        configuration and level select and the hand that activates the
        user interface. Some levels feature technology, but they make up
        a smaller part. Most levels lean towards the organic or mix tech
        and organic shapes.</li>
        <li>The Moai statues seemed a bit out of place. Either they
        reference alien conspiracy theories (Gilles) or the use of Moai
        in Parodius.</li>
        <li>Some of the visual complexity is lost when looking at static
        images. Many actants in the game are animated, even if only so
        slightly. The intro-animation is just a blast and the parallax
        of the background adds to a fluid game play.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="log">Log</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Today I made the first phase of an <a
        href="notes/Auslegeordnung.html">Auslegeordnung</a> with Gilles
        for the <a href="games/Necronom.html">Necronom</a> case study. We
        printed around 120 screenshots from the game. For this small
        collection I decided to use the scrapped screenshots from HOL
        enriched by my own screenshots of the intro, the UI and the
        ending sequence. The material form HOL concentrated a lot on the
        levels and I needed some visuals of the typography and the user
        interface as well. Some of the preliminal findings concern the
        colors, the typography and the visual complexity of the
        levels.</li>
