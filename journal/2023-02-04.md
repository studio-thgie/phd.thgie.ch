After the wonderful kick-off, which cost me a lot of social energy (worth every unit), I got some input on literature.

- Malloy, J., & Aarseth, E. J. (1998). Cybertext, Perspectives on Ergodic Literature. _Leonardo Music Journal_, _8_, 77. [https://doi.org/10.2307/1513408](https://doi.org/10.2307/1513408)

These two came from Addrich. In his dissertation he focus on sound in video games and since this relates to media in video games, I guess they are very much likely foundational for me as well. I was already focused a bit to much on the visuality and visual cultures. I also got the follow book in the mail at the first kick-off day, which is almost kind of a good omen.

Read on, little student, read on.
