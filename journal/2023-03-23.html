        <p>Right now I do feel a bit lost with my dissertation. But I’m
        sure that’s how it has to be right now. I had a meeting with my
        supervisor last week that was very giving in terms on how to go
        forwards. The most important take-away was, that I should speak
        to all my disciplines. That already gives a lot of
        structure.</p>
        <p>If I’d follow such an approach I’d roughly have a paper in
        each of the following areas.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Digital humanities: Research through digital humanities
        methods</li>
        <li>Video games studies: Maybe concentrating on case
        studies</li>
        <li>Design research: For now going in the direction of design
        rhetorics</li>
        <li>Software development: Because I can use my experience and
        background here</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is what I’m currently working on:</p>
        <p><img src="assets/Board_March.png" /></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Building the image and metadata <a
        href="journal/2023-03-10.html">corpus</a></li>
        <li>Thinking through emulators as semiological
        infrastructure</li>
        <li>Investigating the intersection of image and technology in
        video games</li>
        <li>Ball Raider case study: doing semiological research as well
        as discourse analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What I’m missing of course in all of this is an ark that
        brings everything together. I guess I have to talk about that
        with my supervisors once. But for now I should work more through
        the material and also play a bit more. The topic on emulators
        came through the research practise and I once promised myself to
        do more practical research.</p>
        <p>I could also imagine doing interdisciplinary works, but I
        don’t know if that would be a problem for publishing. I guess
        less so in video games studies, as they are used to pull and
        draw from many disciplines.</p>
