        <p>I have a basic assumption after a rather broad reading of
        texts. There seems to be an invisible rift between the research
        image of the video game and its material base, a border between
        the visuality and technology. A lot of the texts I looked at
        concentrate on either side. A few foundational works recognize
        the algorithmic nature of the image in video games, without
        going into technological details. I believe that this is
        happening because the researchers usually just bring one half of
        the needed skill sets.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>It could also be a possibility, that these two halves are
        fundamentally different and that this rift exists, because there
        is no connection. But I doubt that.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Working through this assumption would foremost include a
        proper literature review, having a look at the focus as well as
        methodology of research on the image in video games. If this
        assumption turns out to be true, I would then set out to bring
        these two areas together. My thesis is, that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        video game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. This
        goes the other way as well: Certain targeted modes of reception
        inform the modes of production, such as coding in Assembler on
        PICO-8. <em>Retro</em> is not only a visual approach, but also
        shapes programming practices.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Sidethought: Bridging this divide could possibly enable
        readings of intention on the developers side and inform
        practices of conservation. The code, software and hardware
        needed to run video games could be read as paratexts.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The four papers needed for the cumulative dissertation could
        look something like the following very, very rough draft.</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Techno-historic Limits of our corpus, detailed analysis of
        the systems that were used to <em>see</em> the games.</li>
        <li>Close reading of code and development practices regarding
        their visual output</li>
        <li>Visual rethoric, semiology: Close Reading of our corpus with
        case studies</li>
        <li>Distant Reading of our corpus to look for patterns in games
        in relation to their hardware or emulation</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The four papers would be supportive of the general argument
        of the interplay between material basis and meaning arising from
        the image, and should come together in the final
        dissertation.</p>
        <p>Working title for now: <strong>On code, visuality and
        meaning: Interdisciplinary perspectivest on the image in Swiss
        video games pre-2000</strong></p>
