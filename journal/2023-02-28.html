        - Dissertation Contemplation</h1>
        <p>As a preparation with a first dissertation meeting with my
        supervisor I note my expectations, thoughts and questions
        here.</p>
        <h2 id="contemplation">Contemplation</h2>
        <h3 id="my-expectations-towards-the-research-project">My
        expectations towards the research project</h3>
        <h3 id="how-can-my-supervisor-support-me">How can my supervisor
        support me?</h3>

        dissertation</h3>
        <p>Within the research group I’m part of, I hold two
        positions:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>PhD student with an independent dissertation</li>
        <li>PhD researcher on <em>History of Visual Design of Early
        Swiss Video Games</em>, defined as such</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The aim of this dissertation project is a historiography of
        graphic design in the games developed in Switzerland during the
        observed period. By focusing on the visual rhetoric and the
        iconography of the games, (trans)national historical
        continuities and transmedial influences are to be elaborated on
        the one hand. The aim is to create a critical catalogue of
        visual design that enables us to recognize connections and
        discrepancies. But the aim is also to work out the creative
        means that determine design. The loading screen of the text
        adventure game Züri (1992), for example, is oriented quite
        closely to the motif of the tourist city panorama, while the
        construction game Traders (1991) uses a comic style that is
        rather unusual for the genre. To what extent can local
        influences be identified in the graphic style, interface but
        also in the packaging and advertising in computer journals?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The goals for the researching position would be:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>A database will be created with images from the game but
        also from the paratexts (box, advertisement, etc).</li>
        <li>These images will then be analyzed with the tools of
        Rhetorical Design Analysis and compared to other dominant
        graphical sources in Swiss popular culture.</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>My own position as PhD student is somewhere at the
        intersection of</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Digital Humanities (especially with my background in
        software development)</li>
        <li>Design Research (research style and methodologies through my
        former studies)</li>
        <li>Video Game Studies</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Database: general questions about the who and where and
        what?</li>
        <li>How much liberties do I have in my own dissertation in
        regards to the researching position?</li>
        </ul>
