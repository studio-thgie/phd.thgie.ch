        Feb 2023 - Dissertation and Project Contemplation</h1>
        <p>As a preparation for a first dissertation meeting with my
        supervisor, I note my expectations, thoughts and questions
        here.</p>
        <h2 id="contemplation">Contemplation</h2>
        <h3 id="my-expectations-towards-the-research-project">My
        expectations towards the research project</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Foremost, I am absurdly grateful to have this chance, being
        able to work on this topic and in such a configuration. My most
        important expectation is, that the project lets me keep up this
        spirit for the next four years</li>
        <li>I want to be able to profit from the interdisciplinarity. In
        my experience, that aspect is tough, but doable. It means effort
        on all sides, and sometimes this effort has to be decided on
        <em>by management</em></li>
        <li>In a best case scenario, the project becomes a stronghold
        for more difficult times. A place where I can retreat into, and
        get support, when shit hits the fan (stress and anxities,
        academic problems)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="how-can-my-supervisor-support-me">How can my supervisor
        support me?</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>I can deal with critique, most of the time :) Please be
        direct and constructive.</li>
        <li>Coming from practice-based research, I’ll need guidance with
        the humanities part of academic knowledge work. I am a noob
        considering conferences, publishing procedures, and these kinds
        of things. I guess I got the reading and writing part by
        now</li>
        <li>Topic-wise, I’m also a noob concerning theories and methods
        in historical research. I know that these things are important
        for me, but I don’t see our respective interfaces right now</li>
        <li>At times, I am too uncritical, engaging things for their
        practicalities and having a blind spot for weaknesses. I could
        use some support in critical thinking</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="direction-of-my-dissertation">Direction of my
        dissertation</h3>
        <p>Within the research group I’m part of, I hold two
        positions:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>PhD student with an independent dissertation</li>
        <li>PhD researcher on <em>History of Visual Design of Early
        Swiss Video Games</em>, defined as such</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The aim of this dissertation project is a historiography of
        graphic design in the games developed in Switzerland during the
        observed period. By focusing on the visual rhetoric and the
        iconography of the games, (trans)national historical
        continuities and transmedial influences are to be elaborated on
        the one hand. The aim is to create a critical catalogue of
        visual design that enables us to recognize connections and
        discrepancies. But the aim is also to work out the creative
        means that determine design. The loading screen of the text
        adventure game Züri (1992), for example, is oriented quite
        closely to the motif of the tourist city panorama, while the
        construction game Traders (1991) uses a comic style that is
        rather unusual for the genre. To what extent can local
        influences be identified in the graphic style, interface but
        also in the packaging and advertising in computer journals?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The goals for the researching position would be:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>A database will be created with images from the game but
        also from the paratexts (box, advertisement, etc).</li>
        <li>These images will then be analyzed with the tools of
        Rhetorical Design Analysis and compared to other dominant
        graphical sources in Swiss popular culture.</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>My own position as a PhD student is somewhere at the
        intersection of</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Digital Humanities (especially with my background in
        software development)</li>
        <li>Design Research (research style and methodologies through my
        former studies)</li>
        <li>Video Game Studies (given through the project)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have the feeling, as of right now, that this intersection
        is huge and I’m not very sure, where exactly I want to stand.
        That said, I know that I don’t want to solely make a rhetoric
        analysis of the image material. My background as a software
        developer is too valuable in the light of <a
        href="notes/Visuality%20in%20Video%20Games.html">the
        particularities of the image in video games</a>. Given the state
        of <a href="notes/Literature.html">literature</a> I could observe
        by now as well as that video games as cultural heritage is a
        rather young approach, I’d say that <a
        href="notes/Emulation.html">emulation</a>, virtualization and <a
        href="notes/Preservation.html">preservation</a> are things I want
        to have a good look at. Although I don’t know, how to get from
        there to <em>the image</em> of video games.</p>
        <p>Do I need to consider having my dissertation about something
        <em>completely else</em>? As in, purely speculative, the
        non-human representation in video games?</p>
        <h2 id="questions-and-thoughts">Questions and thoughts</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Practicalities: Cummulative dissertation and studies</li>
        <li>What does <em>the project</em> expect of me?</li>
        <li>Timing, especially since studies take up a lot of time for
        the first year. A kind of project planning for the comming
        month?</li>
        <li>How many liberties do I have in my own dissertation in
        regard to the researching position?</li>
        <li>There is a lot of great stuff going on in Montréal. What is
        the opinion on a semester abroad?</li>
        <li>How will the dissertation form my outlook on postdocs?</li>
        <li>Database: general questions about the who and where and
        what?</li>
        <li>Participation DiGRA Sevilla, and besides, what else is
        recommended?</li>
        <li>Opinion on <a
