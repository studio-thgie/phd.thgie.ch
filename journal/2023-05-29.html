        and computing history</h1>
        <p>I have a few first thoughts on treating a <a
        href="notes/Distant%20Reading%20the%20VICE%20Source%20Code.html">code
        repository as source for distant reading methods</a>. There are
        two imminent aspects</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>I’m not very experienced in corpus analysis, and it
        shows</li>
        <li>Despite being written for humans and machines, source code
        heavily leans to the latter and eludes from being analysed by
        the likes of Voyant tools</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There is an interesting part in Mark C. Marino’s early text
        on <a
        href="literature/marinoCriticalCodeStudies2012.html">Critical Code
        Studies</a> about source code being double coded, which he
        picked up at Mateas and Montfort.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Ultimately, they conclude that “All coding inevitably
        involves double coding. ‘Good’ code simultaneously specifies a
        mechanical process and talks about this mechanical process to a
        human reader”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I’m not convinced, tools like Voyant can deal with such
        double coding, being made for texts for human consumption
        only.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this primer on how old computer graphics
        worked:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://youtu.be/Tfh0ytz8S0k">How “oldschool”
        graphics worked Part 1 - Commodore and Nintendo</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://youtu.be/_rsycfDliZU">How “oldschool”
        graphics work, part 2 - Apple and Atari</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://youtu.be/niKblgZupOc">CGA Graphics - Not as
        bad as you thought!</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’m trying to slowly getting into understanding the
        technological side of old computer or video game graphics. If I
        want to do some proper design rhetorics I will need to get my
        hands dirty as well, sooner or later, and not just analyse.</p>
