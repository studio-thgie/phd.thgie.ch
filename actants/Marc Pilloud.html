        . will also be interesting in a later interview to discuss about
        technology behind. one interesting thing is also that they use
        the hires graphic mode. “hals und beinbruch”</h2>
        <p>While searching for a mail of him I found a mail from 2013,
        from my BA at HyperWerk in Basel. He was announced for giving a
        workshop at our institute and titled “comparis-Mitgründer Marc
        Pilloud”, which I didn’t knew <img
        src="https://discord.com/assets/b45af785b0e648fe2fb7e318a6b8010c.svg"
        alt="😅" /> He also co-developed a thing called “Fonopoly”:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Ich habe später 2001 mit Fonopoly auch noch ein anderes Spiel
        “mit-entwickelt”. Es war eines der ganz frühen Mixed Reality
        Spiele in der Schweiz. Leider gibt es nicht mehr viele Infos
        dazu. Der Hauptentwickler war Christoph Ellenberger, die
        Idee/Konzeption war wesentlich eine Adaption von einem Spiel das
        wir ohne IT in Lagern mit Kindern gespielt haben.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>So, there is an interesting trajectory from making games in
        1986 to working on “innovative” digital projects in 2000 and
        later.</p>
        <h2 id="memo-interview-2023-08-28">Memo Interview
        2023-08-28</h2>
        <p>I was a bit nervous about the setup. Finding a place wasn’t
        straight forward. The participant hesitated to invite me to his
        home and I didn’t want to push on that end. We figured that a
        public coffee-place of his choosing would be the best option. I
        checked the place out and it seem to be a rather neutral place,
        without music but with possible background noise. I tested how
        my recording setup (iPhone and Zoom iQ7) would handle that and
        decided that it would produce a useable recording. I also
        prepared a few topics that I could mention if the discussion
        stalls.</p>
        <p>We met in said coffee, the participant already prepared and
        was halfway through a coffee, although I was already 20 minutes
        to early. I felt the participant to be slightly at unease, not
        quite sure what will await him. I started with some chit chat
        before hand, sharing my experience with my train ride and, after
        getting a coffee for myself, continue to introduce myself as
        well as explain the research project and our approach to oral
        history.</p>
        <p>The participant brought with some design- and
        production-documents from the time they created the game Robox
        in 1985/86. We didn’t delve right away into those documents, but
        I let him explain the context and some overview of the game.
        What followed was a meandering retelling of his own life, and I
        felt the interview leaning heavily towards the intimate. He
        scratched and mentioned difficulties that were in relationship
        to the participants personal life, social network, and career.
        He also stated personal opinions and point of views that I know
        he would be judged against in other contexts. I’m still a bit
        taken by the depth of the highly personal insights he gave
        during this interview, although not oversharing.</p>
        <p>Next to getting insights into different moments of the
        participant’s life and doings, we came back to Robox every now
        and then and he was able to outline some important to and
        interesting bits of how the game came to life. He mentioned his
        friend Laro a few times and spoke well of him. We said, that he
        will contact Laro, to ask him if he would be open for an
        interview as well.</p>
