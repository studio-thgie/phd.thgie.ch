# Sourcecode as Text
[Critical Code Analysis](notes/Critical%20Code%20Analysis.md) treats code not only as functional but as a cultural artefact written by and for humans, as text. But to what extend can it be treated as text? Is text in a literary sense or does it lean rather towards text in Foucauldian sense, as in something that can be read and analysed towards meaning?

In my tests on using [VICE and Distant Reading](notes/VICE%20and%20Distant%20Reading.md) I figured on of the biggest problems to be the non-linearity of sourcecode. There is no clear beginning and no clear and, instead, sourcecode is highly networked and referential. Parts are included and reused, moduralized and broken up into pieces. That makes it pretty tough to read linear patterns from it, as the sourcecode is not sortable.
