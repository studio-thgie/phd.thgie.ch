        <p>Jørgensen argues to reflect on the terms.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Two concepts from narrative theory that often appears in
        discussions about game sound are <em>diegetic</em> and
        <em>non-diegetic</em> (Collins, 2007, 2008; Ekman 2005; Grimshaw
        2008; Grimshaw &amp; Schott 2007; Jørgensen 2007b, 2008;
        Stockburger, 2003; Whalen, 2004). The terms are used in film
        theory to separate elements that can be said to be part of the
        depicted fictional world from elements that the fictional
        characters cannot see or hear and which should be considered
        non-existent in the fictional world (Bordwell, 1986; Bordwell
        &amp; Thompson, 1997). According to this approach, dialogue
        between two characters is seen as diegetic, while background
        score music is seen as non-diegetic. In connection with game
        sound, a likely adaptation of these concepts would describe the
        response “More work?” from an orc peon unit in the real-time
        strategy game <em>Warcraft 3</em> (Blizzard, 2002) as an example
        of a <em>diegetic sound</em> since it is spoken by a character
        within the gameworld. Music that signals approaching enemies in
        the role-playing game <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> (Bioware,
        2009) would according to this view be an example of
        <em>non-diegetic sound</em> since the music is not being played
        from a source within the game universe.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>However, when analyzing the examples more closely, we see
        that using these terms in computer games is confusing and at
        best inaccurate. As a response to a player command, the “More
        work?” question has an ambiguous status in relation to the
        gameworld: If we ask ourselves who the peon is talking to, it
        appears to address the player, who is not represented as a
        character in the gameworld, but manages the troops and base from
        the outside of the gameworld. The warning music heard in the
        role-playing game is also ambiguous. Although there is nothing
        to suggest that the music is being played by an orchestra in the
        wilderness, there is no doubt that the music influences the
        players’ tactical decisions and therefore has direct consequence
        for the player-characters’ actions and the progression of the
        game. The confusion comes into being because game sound has a
        double status in which it provides usability information to the
        player at the same time as it has been stylized to fit the
        depicted fictional world. It works as support for gameplay,
        while also providing a sense of presence in the gameworld
        (Jørgensen, 2007a, 2009; Nacke &amp; Grimshaw, 2011). From this
        point of view, diegetic and non-diegetic sounds tend to blend
        systematically in games, thereby creating additional levels of
        communication compared to the traditional diegetic versus
        non-diegetic divide.</p>
