        <h2 id="section">2023-03-30</h2>
        <p>How is visual meaning derrived from code? How does code turn
        into meaningful visuality?</p>
        <h2 id="section-1">2023-03-24</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>What’s the impact of loading times on the game
        experience?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="section-2">2023-03-17</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>If the <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/">research of
        Fabian Sanglard</a> shows one thing, then that the visuality of
        video games is inherently linked to materiality. There is not
        one without the other.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="section-3">2023-03-07</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>My gut feeling tells me, there is some interesting link
        between authenticity, <a href="notes/Emulation.html">emulation</a>
        and <a href="notes/Semiotics.html">semiotics</a>, in regards to
        the image.</li>
        <li>How to machine assisted semiology in traversing large
        archives of pop-cultural images?</li>
        <li>Are video games multimodal?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="section-4">2023-02-27</h2>
        <p>Where is the invisible labour in all of these games? Can we
        avoid recreating a narrative of white and priviledged men? Why
        are the gameworls we look at mostly about shooting, and scifi,
        economics and such things, traditionally ascribed to
        masculinity?</p>
        <p>What is absent (intersectionaly seen) in our corpus?</p>
        <h2 id="section-5">2023-02-24</h2>
        <p>How about having a good look at all the platforms that,
        mostly illegaly, collect old games for preservation
        purposes?</p>
        <h2 id="section-6">2023-02-22</h2>
        <p>How do emulators and their contextual technologies, such as
        displays, change our experience of game play?</p>
        <h2 id="section-7">2023-02-10</h2>
        <p>The endless circulation of the retro game image in todays
        media landscape. (poping up as a reaction to the Images in
        Social Media workshop)</p>
        <h2 id="section-8">2023-02-09</h2>
        <p>Something about reconstructing the images of the past. How
        the inages vanish with the technology and how emulation is not a
        replacement. Also something something semiology about how the
        image was related to the screen and to the room around it. How
        that is lost as well. So preservation of these images could also
        be a subject, because screenshots and video recordings don’t
        preserve the ergodic animage.</p>
        <h2 id="section-9">2023-01-11</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Materiality of digital born graphics</li>
        <li>Close reading AI generated images</li>
        <li>How technology (code, software) forms and frames the images
        we can produce</li>
        <li>What’s visible, what’s not visible</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="section-10">2023-01-12</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>How do video game graphics life on, or beyond their
        respective games? On game platforms, screenshots, fan culture,
        etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="section-11">2023-01-13</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>How does participation (as in gameplay) change the reception
        of an image?</li>
        <li>How does the player become a co-creator of visual material,
        through gameplay?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="section-12">2023-01-23</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Participation and code radically changes the production and
        reception of images in video games. The glitch in Ball Raiser is
        part of it’s reception.</li>
