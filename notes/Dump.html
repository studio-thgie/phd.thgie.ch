        <p>Why is it, that we have so little C64 games in
        Switzerland?</p>
        <h2 id="section-1">2023-05-28</h2>
        <p>What is the social relevance of my dissertation approach? I
        could think of the power in the hands of people who can code in
        order to produce images. How does this class of creatives
        structure the image in video games? Maybe there is something to
        be found in the research on the networked image.</p>
        <h2 id="section-2">2023-05-22</h2>
        <p>It is hardly possible to see beyond the horizon of
        transformation from code to image. Looking at the visuality one
        can only make assumption about the code and vice versa. This has
        a profound impact on designing visuality through code.</p>
        <h2 id="section-3">2023-05-17</h2>
        <p>Coding for visuality involves multimodal design. The code
        written and the output generated by that code does not correlate
        aesthetically. The brief moment of translation, from one system
        of signifiers into another happens already in the coders mind
        (or knowledge) before the computational act itself. There is a
        double rhetoric at play, one for the code, one for the
        visuality.</p>

        <h2 id="section-5">2023-05-10</h2>
        <p>In my dissertation, I am essentially interested in the
        transformation or translation of meaning from one system of
        signifiers into another. It is a multi modal approach. The
        materiality of visuality in video games is only on the surface
        comparable to paint in the painting. It is much closer to
        artworks where the artist wrote instructions. The basis of the
        image in video games is of textual nature, and as such opens it
        self to being analysed like a literal text.</p>

        <li>Dissertation, thought, slow down the process of input to
        output, make the processing human experience album by thick
        description of what’s happening inside of the computer
        system</li>
        <li>Really go in-depth into this moment of transformation from
        input to computing system and code and back to output</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="section-7">2023-03-30</h2>
        <p>How is visual meaning derrived from code? How does code turn
        into meaningful visuality?</p>
        <h2 id="section-8">2023-03-24</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>What’s the impact of loading times on the game

        <ul>
        <li>If the <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/">research of
        Fabian Sanglard</a> shows one thing, then that the visuality of
        video games is inherently linked to materiality. There is not
        one without the other.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="section-10">2023-03-07</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>My gut feeling tells me, there is some interesting link
        between authenticity, <a href="notes/Emulation.html">emulation</a>
        and <a href="notes/Semiotics.html">semiotics</a>, in regards to
        the image.</li>
        <li>How to machine assisted semiology in traversing large
        archives of pop-cultural images?</li>
        <li>Are video games multimodal?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="section-11">2023-02-27</h2>
        <p>Where is the invisible labour in all of these games? Can we
        avoid recreating a narrative of white and priviledged men? Why
        are the gameworls we look at mostly about shooting, and scifi,
        economics and such things, traditionally ascribed to
        masculinity?</p>
        <p>What is absent (intersectionaly seen) in our corpus?</p>
        <h2 id="section-12">2023-02-24</h2>
        <p>How about having a good look at all the platforms that,
        mostly illegaly, collect old games for preservation
        purposes?</p>
        <h2 id="section-13">2023-02-22</h2>
        <p>How do emulators and their contextual technologies, such as
        displays, change our experience of game play?</p>
        <h2 id="section-14">2023-02-10</h2>
        <p>The endless circulation of the retro game image in todays
        media landscape. (poping up as a reaction to the Images in
        Social Media workshop)</p>
        <h2 id="section-15">2023-02-09</h2>
        <p>Something about reconstructing the images of the past. How
        the inages vanish with the technology and how emulation is not a
        replacement. Also something something semiology about how the
        image was related to the screen and to the room around it. How
        that is lost as well. So preservation of these images could also
        be a subject, because screenshots and video recordings don’t
        preserve the ergodic animage.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>How does participation (as in gameplay) change the reception

        <li>Participation and code radically changes the production and
        reception of images in video games. The glitch in Ball Raiser is
        part of it’s reception.</li>
