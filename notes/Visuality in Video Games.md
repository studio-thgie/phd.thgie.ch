# Visuality in Video Games
There are different types of images to be found in and around video games.

- [the image during play](notes/The%20Game%20FAVR.md), what is mostly centering around the mediated space in Nitsche
- [the image of play](literature/mauchInGamePhotographieBildwirklichkeit2017.md), such as screenshots, in-game photography or screencasts
- [paratextual visual material](literature/fernandez-varaIntroductionGameAnalysis2019.md), such as box art, manuals or other ephemera
