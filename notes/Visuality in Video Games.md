# Visuality in Video Games
There are different types of images to be found in and around video games.

- the image during play[^1], what is mostly centering around the mediated space in Nitsche
- the image of play[^2], such as screenshots, in-game photography or screencasts
- paratextual visual material[^3], such as box art, manuals or other ephemera
