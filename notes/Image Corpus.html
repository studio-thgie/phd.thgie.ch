        <h1 id="image-corpus">Image Corpus</h1>
        <p>The image corpus is built following a strategy to include as
        much material as is necessary to fully represent a games’
        visuality (aesthetics and content). Next to formal and semiotic
        elements and paratextual material, the Game FAVR model of
        categorization for the visuality of a digital game is applied to
        collect material. Since building a corpus of images retrieved
        from digital games can be a considerable effort regarding having
        to play entire games<a href="/notes/Image Corpus.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, additional
        collecting strategies are considered.</p>
        <p>I exclude videos from my analysis as of now, since they
        introduce new technical considerations and research
        problematics, such as the analysis of progression in time, the
        storage of the collected media or how to properly code (label)
        videos. This aspect will stay problematic for now, as some
        objects only reveal themselves in animations, for example
        special effects that indicate a change of game state.</p>
        <p>The <a href="notes/Game%20FAVR.html">Game FAVR</a> is clear in
        outline and scope and is mostly considered with the macro and
        material perspective on the image in digital games. Formal and
        semiotic elements can vary in their scope and focus towards the
        micro level of a game. Decisions will have to be made with each
        game, slightly adjusting what is collected. If needed, I’ll
        expand the outlined parameters below. The approach follows
        loosely along compositional analysis, whereas the FAVR takes
        over the spatial components and semiotic elements over
        content.</p>
        <p>Another consideration is the balance between quantity and
        quality, as in, complete visual representation of a game versus
        the quality of the collected images. Producing all the
        screenshots oneself will reduce the amount of treated games
        because of the needed effort. On the other hand, screenshots of
        play-throughs or scrapping produce lower quality images
        regarding their resolution, having compression artefacts or
        faulty colour spaces. If scrapping can be automated, I will
        include the material either way and mark it as such.</p>
        <p>The paratextual material is restricted to what was issued by
        the developing and publishing actants to keep the analysis
        within the intentions and meaning production of the agencies
        directly involved.</p>
