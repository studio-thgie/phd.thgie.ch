While searching for a mail of him I found a mail from 2013, from my BA at HyperWerk in Basel. He was announced for giving a workshop at our institute and titled "comparis-Mitgr√ºnder Marc Pilloud", which I didn't knew ![üòÖ](https://discord.com/assets/b45af785b0e648fe2fb7e318a6b8010c.svg) He also co-developed a thing called "Fonopoly":

> Ich habe sp√§ter 2001 mit Fonopoly auch noch ein anderes Spiel "mit-entwickelt". Es war eines der ganz fr√ºhen Mixed Reality Spiele in der Schweiz. Leider gibt es nicht mehr viele Infos dazu. Der Hauptentwickler war Christoph Ellenberger, die Idee/Konzeption war wesentlich eine Adaption von einem Spiel das wir ohne IT in Lagern mit Kindern gespielt haben.

> Later in 2001, I also "co-developed" another game, Fonopoly. It was one of the very early mixed reality games in Switzerland. Unfortunately, there is not much more information about it. The main developer was Christoph Ellenberger, the idea/concept was essentially an adaptation of a game we played without IT in camps with children.Later in 2001, I also "co-developed" another game, Fonopoly.

So, there is an interesting trajectory from making games in 1986 to working on "innovative" digital projects in 2000 and later.
