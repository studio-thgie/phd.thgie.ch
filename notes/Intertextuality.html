        <blockquote>
        <p>‘meaning in a text can only ever be understood in relation to
        other texts; no work stands alone but is interlinked with the
        tradition that came before it and the context in which it is
        produced’ (Allen, 2000, p. i)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Put simply, and if we adapt the theory to video games, games
        can only be understood in relation to other video games. […]
        This argument could be pushed further. One could add that
        derivatives from games – such as ports, rereleases, emulation
        and fan fictions – use their direct ancestor, the original
        version, as intertext. The concept of intertextuality also
        accounts for the influences of other sources. ‘The systems,
        codes and traditions of other art forms and of culture in
        general are also crucial to the meaning of a work of literature’
        (Allen, 2000, p. 1). In other words, to truly understand
        literature, or in this case video games, one must also look to
        other media that influence the design and creation of the games.
        Like text, video games are not only influenced by other games
        but also by culture and other art forms.” (Guay-Bélanger,
        “Assembling Auras.”)</p>
