        <p>video game graphics are digital-born objects, results of
        software-instructions and hardware-calculations. despite easy
        digital access, the digitality and techno-historic limits of
        video game images has not been well researched yet. video game
        graphics are more often than not treated like any other image,
        without taking their specifics into account. traditional imager
        research focus on content not formal aspects, especially true
        for video game images. applying favr to teach machines to see
        the specifics</p>
        <ul>
        <li>claim
        <ul>
        <li>since video game images not only have aesthetical and
        narrative aspects, but also functional, traditional image
        analysis struggles with its vocabulary.</li>
        <li>video game images are not only narrative devices, like in
        movies, where they apply visual information and aesthetics in
        order to communicate a story or invoke affects. the images of
        video games also have to convey game states, for example lives
        or where one is at the moment in relation to the overall game,
        bringing them closer to user interfaces. and, most importantly,
        video game images also have to communicate participation and
        interaction possibility. they have to tell you what you can or
        must do, as a player, in order to proceed.</li>
        <li>favr as an attempt to structure video game graphics by their
        functional, material and formal aspects, enabling structuring of
        large corpora with completely different games and the analysis
        of different games from the same period of time</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>data
        <ul>
        <li>working on video game graphics from games from the 80s and
        90s from Switzerland.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>method
        <ul>
        <li>What is favr</li>
        <li>research into valiability of translating favr into the
        digital. attempt to bridge the gap between formal aspects of the
        image and critical code analysis</li>
        <li>my intentions are to make video game graphics, as well as
        their specifics, accessable to proper metadata modelling and
        machine reading. I already made initial tests in translating the
        FAVR model into an ontology and applying it in Tropy. A next
        step would be to see to what extend this qualitative annotation
        can be automated and what new knowledge can be generated, once a
        larger corpus has been enriched through this model.</li>

        right for the paper on <a

        research on the visuality of older digital games in
        Switzerland</a>. They drop the AI and algorithm keyword a few
        times without being very specific about it. I will certainly not
        touch that. But the focus on the methodological interplay of
        close and distant reading would be perfect for a
        design-research/digital-humanities approach. I also think that
        proposing a paper on historical research of a digital-born image
        corpus can give me an advantage. There is not to much of such
        things going on.</li>
