## Notes
### 2023-11-27
video game graphics are digital-born objects, results of software-instructions and hardware-calculations. despite easy digital access, the digitality and  techno-historic limits of video game images has not been well researched yet. video game graphics are more often than not treated like any other image, without taking their specifics into account.  traditional imager research focus on content not formal aspects, especially true for video game images. applying favr to teach machines to see the specifics 

- claim
	- since video game images not only have aesthetical and narrative aspects, but also functional, traditional image analysis struggles with its vocabulary.
	- video game images are not only narrative devices, like in movies, where they apply visual information and aesthetics in order to communicate a story or invoke affects. the images of video games also have to convey game states, for example lives or where one is at the moment in relation to the overall game, bringing them closer to user interfaces. and, most importantly, video game images also have to communicate participation and interaction possibility. they have to tell you what you can or must do, as a player, in order to proceed.
	- favr as an attempt to structure video game graphics by their functional, material and formal aspects, enabling structuring of large corpora with completely different games and the analysis of different games from the same period of time
- data
	- working on video game graphics from games from the 80s and 90s from Switzerland.
- method
	- What is favr
	- research into valiability of translating favr into the digital. attempt to bridge the gap between formal aspects of the image and critical code analysis
	- my intentions are to make video game graphics, as well as their specifics, accessable to proper metadata modelling and machine reading. I already made initial tests in translating the FAVR model into an ontology and applying it in Tropy. A next step would be to see to what extend this qualitative annotation can be automated and what new knowledge can be generated, once a larger corpus has been enriched through this model.

> Submit an abstract of no more than 300 words that clearly outlines the title, purpose, methodology, findings, and implications of your research project, research method, software, data, or tool.
> "Historical Research, Digital Literacy and Algorithmic Criticism". We are particularly interested in papers that address ongoing research projects, innovative research methods, the use of software in historical research, data analysis, and digital tools.
> Papers should provide insightful analysis, provoke thoughtful discussion, and contribute to the understanding and advancement of digital literacy and algorithmic criticism in historical research.

- algorithmic criticism
	- video game graphics as results of soft- and hardware, digital-born
- digital literacy
	- how do we read and analyse video game graphics
	- something about the long tradition of image research (qualitative) and digital approaches beyond cultural analytics (quantitative, metadata) -> the interplay of close and distant reading in image analysis
- historical research
	- defined by corpus

The timing would be quite right for the paper on [Historical research on the visuality of older digital games in Switzerland](notes/expose.md#Work%20Package%202%20–%202.%20half%202024). They drop the AI and algorithm keyword a few times without being very specific about it. I will certainly not touch that. But the focus on the methodological interplay of close and distant reading would be perfect for a design-research/digital-humanities approach. I also think that proposing a paper on historical research of a digital-born image corpus can give me an advantage. There is not to much of such things going on.
