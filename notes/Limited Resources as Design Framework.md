# Limited Resources as a Design Framework
There is a vibrant, although niche, community, that willingly stays within the frame of the old and has many reasons to do so, not only nostalgia or seeking a challenge. What makes programming video games or generative graphics appealing within limited resolution and colours and being more complicated to realise? I believe that [Coding as World-Making](notes/Coding%20as%20World-Making.md) is part of the answer. Specific modes of creating as a way of being in the world.
