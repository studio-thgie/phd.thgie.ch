# Emulation
Emulation can make gameplay accessible, but it will also change it. It is thus important to be reflective of that aspect and to contextualize it. It should not be the sole source of analyzing a game. It differs from virtualization. Where as “Virtualization **relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system**.” (VMWare)

- *2023-06-12* After reading the two texts from Stefan Höltgen and André Fachat I'm fascinated by the translation of hardware into software. No concrete thoughts, but the meticulousness and decisions that go into emulating a hardware-based clocking process are dense. I also got some insights into [Sourcecode as Text](notes/Sourcecode%20as%20Text.md).
