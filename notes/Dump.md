- My gut feeling tells me, there is some interesting link between authenticity, [emulation](notes/Emulation.md) and [semiotics](notes/Semiotics.md), in regards to the image.
- How to machine assisted semiology in traversing large archives of pop-cultural images?
- Are video games multimodal?

Where is the invisible labour in all of these games? Can we avoid recreating a narrative of white and priviledged men? Why are the gameworls we look at mostly about shooting, and scifi, economics and such things, traditionally ascribed to masculinity?

What is absent (intersectionaly seen) in our corpus?

How about having a good look at all the platforms that, mostly illegaly, collect old games for preservation purposes?

How do emulators and their contextual technologies, such as displays, change our experience of game play?

The endless circulation of the retro game image in todays media landscape. (poping up as a reaction to the Images in Social Media workshop)

Something about reconstructing the images of the past. How the inages vanish with the technology and how emulation is not a replacement. Also something something semiology about how the image was related to the screen and to the room around it. How that is lost as well. So preservation of these images could also be a subject, because screenshots and video recordings don't preserve the ergodic animage.

- Materiality of digital born graphics
- Close reading AI generated images
- How technology (code, software) forms and frames the images we can produce
- What's visible, what's not visible

- How do video game graphics life on, or beyond their respective games? On game platforms, screenshots, fan culture, etc.

- How does participation (as in gameplay) change the reception of an image?
- How does the player become a co-creator of visual material, through gameplay?

## 2023-01-23
- Participation and code radically changes the production and reception of images in video games. The glitch in Ball Raiser is part of it's reception.
