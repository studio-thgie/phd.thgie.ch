# Greaseweazle
> **Greaseweazle** is a USB device and host tools allowing versatile floppy drive control. By extracting the raw flux transitions from a drive, any disk format can be captured and analysed: PC, Amiga, Amstrad, PDP-11, musical instruments, industrial equipment, and more. Greaseweazle also supports writing to floppy disks, from a range of image file formats including those commonly used for online preservation (ADF, IPF, DSK, IMG, HFE, ...).

I acquired a Greaseweazle in order to dump and write Amiga floppies. I wanted to be able to play games, that we only have as [[ROMs]], on the original hardware. Modern USB-floppy drives can't write those old formats correctly. It also enabled us to dump floppies of games or software, that we think need to have a backup or be shared. There are some more professional alternatives to Greaseweazle, but for our needs and efforts, this was more than enough.
