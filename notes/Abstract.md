# Abstract
I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the research on the image of the video game and its material base. The image of video games brings with its own specificities. The constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from the hardware's calculation. It is interactive and as such holds within itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing itself upon the player's input. Research on the image of video games more often than not focuses either on the constituted and visible image, or it's material basis â€“ either on visuality or technology.

Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of video game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole. The methods used in this approach are lent from digital humanities, design research and new materialism with a focus on technology studies.

If we take a closer look at the image of video games and accept it as an artifact that is calculated and constructed by code and computer hardware, we can conclude that the underlying technology is formative for its discourse and meaning. Respectively, that the technicians, such as programmers and graphic designers familiar with code, are significantly involved in the circulation and formation of meanings and power relations through the image in video games.
