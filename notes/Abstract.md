# Abstract
The attribution of nationality to a creative work seems like a common act. An author born in Switzerland and writing about Switzerland clearly produces Swiss texts, it seems? This attribution has to be seen critically and reframed as claiming within nationalism of old and new alike. Nations are not a given natural fact, but the results of negotiations within political agendas. Attribution of nationality then, as in *country of origin*, is a political and selective act to establish specific political narratives.

Digital games are produced by networks of actants, as many other modern creative works – developer studios, publishers, programmers, graphic artists, writers, and so on. Any of these as well as the content of the game could be used towards and attribution of nationality. But, what exactly makes a digital game being a specific nationality? When investigated in detail, such choices can seem random and underline rather a political narrative than a factuality.

This dissertation project inquires into the complexity of ascribing nationality to digital games in early games attributed to Switzerland. The research focus lies on the visuality, the image  on screen and paratextual material. Images can be deliberately inscribed with nationalism or read towards involuntarily traces of such. Either way, they can be investigated towards meaningful findings regarding the outlined complexity in this dissertation project.

I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the research on the image of the digital game and its material base. The image of digital games brings with its own specificities. The constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from the hardware's calculation. It is interactive and as such holds within itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing itself upon the player's input. Research on the image of digital games more often than not focuses either on the constituted and visible image, or its material basis – either on visuality or technology.

Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of digital game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent from digital humanities, design research and video game studies and assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical reading the visuality of digital games.
