# Abstract
The abstract corresponds to *[1. Introduction and problem statement](notes/expose.md#1.%20Introduction%20and%20problem%20statement)* of the expose.

I'm interested in the visual design of digital games[^9]. Within that context I'm especially interested in how game developers, or designers, create the images seen on screen through programming. This way of designing, writing code to generate images, is rather like describing a structure on a an abstract level than physically drawing a line on paper. This specific bridging of two different worlds, the technical and the aesthetic, is not well researched, despite being acknowledged as a fundamental aspect of digital game design.
