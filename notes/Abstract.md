# Abstract
Video games are manifestations of designerly intentions, which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into a product. People of all trades, from code to graphics, thus transform their knowledge and skills into a playable and meaningful experience. But as cultural products, video games communicate much more than these design intentions. They also integrate unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and ideologies.

This is equally true for the visuality of the video game, on which this proposal is concentrating. To analyse this, I will present an approach to a critical and close reading of the transformation of code to images. Drawing on critical code analysis and discourse analysis, I combine methodologies from design research and the digital humanities. Critical readings serve the purpose of unearthing and dissecting power structures and the generation of meaning in and from our cultural artefacts. Such readings open up our research objects to a plethora of interpretations.

The images in video games differ from paintings or photographs. They are not materially fixed in time-space, but procedurally generated in the moment of play. If we take a closer look at the image of video games and accept it as an artefact that is calculated and constructed by code and computer hardware, we must conclude that the underlying technology is formative for its discourse and meaning. Respectively, that programmers and graphic designers alike are significantly involved in the circulation and formation of meanings and power relations through the image in video games.

Research on the visuality of video games largely ignores the interplay and interconnection of visuality and its technological underlayer. There seems to be a hard to bridge gap, a momentum where the description of images is transformed into the visuality of video games. It's a moment where meaning is transfered from one system of signifiers (code) into another (visuality), from one sphere of disciplines to another. This calls for an approach depending on interactional expertise. Coming from design research I am interested into how these two spheres are part of a whole, being created by people with intentions and having effects.

In my approach assume a hitherto invisible rift between the research on the image of the digital game and its material base. The image of digital games brings with its own specificities. The constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from the hardware's[^1] calculation. It is interactive and as such holds within itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing itself upon the player's input. Research on the image of digital games more often than not focuses either on the constituted and visible image, or its material basis – either on visuality or technology.

Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of digital game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent from digital humanities, design research and video game studies and assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical reading the visuality of digital games.
