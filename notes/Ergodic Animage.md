# Ergodic Animage
The two terms composing ergodic animage are defined as following.

- “Aarseth’s (1997) ergodicity (the interactive process of working to create a path through the configuration of a textual machine with no guarantee of success (p.1, p.179))” ([Arsenault et al., p. 91](zotero://select/library/items/ZNK5QH67))
- “Gaudreault and Marion’s (2013) animage (a “ type of film image that is born from the expressive potential of the digital and that crystallizes the current spreading of a cultural series formerly neglected by the cinema institution: animation” (p.256))” ([Arsenault et al., p. 91](zotero://select/library/items/ZNK5QH67))

In the words of the authors, the “ergodic animage is the meeting point and mediating factor between the player’s agency and the game’s visual representation of its internal state.” ([Arsenault et al., p. 91](zotero://select/library/items/ZNK5QH67))
