This dissertation project inquires the complex interplay of code and visuality in digital games and is part of the Sinergia funded Confoederatio Ludens research project[^1]. The research focus lies on early games attributed to Switzerland and their visuality, mainly the image seen on screen.  Digital games are manifestations of designerly intentions, which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into an output. These games communicate much more than the intentioned designs. They also capture unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and ideologies, as well as historical contexts. This is equally true for the visuality of the video game. 

In my thesis, I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the research on the image of the digital game and its material base. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent from digital humanities, design research and video game studies and assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical reading the visuality of digital games. A core focus lies on critical code analysis [@willumsenSourceCodeFormal2016; @marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020] as well as design rhetoric [@schnellerDesignRhetoricStudying2015; @scheuermannRhetorischeDesignanalyseUnd2017].

## Corpora and data
Part of the research objective is the creation and maintenance of three corpora. All three corpora are built and maintained with FAIR/CARE principles in mind.

1. A comprehensive list of Swiss digital games until the year 2000 and their accompanying metadata, such as factual information, computing systems, genre, and actors involved in the development and distribution. Maintained on Wikidata[^2]
2. A catalogue of images containing visual material for the games in the first corpus, which serves as the base for visual analysis and design rhetoric[^3]
3. An archive of source code from the games in the first corpus, to be read through critical code analysis

## Source code
The source code of the researched games is of special interest to me. Critical code analysis treats code not only as functional instructions to a machine, but also as a text that can be hermeneutically approached and semiotically read [@marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020]. Further, from the perspective of design theory, a digital game is a second order design [@willumsenSourceCodeFormal2016]. The game developers don't design the game, they design the structures that generate the game. Together, these two approaches outline source code as a carrier of meaning, as well as the tools and material for designing games. This makes source code a core focus of my dissertation.

Challenges working with digital games' source code include:

- Source code needs certain levels of knowledge and experience to fruitfully analyse it in close readings
- Distant reading approaches for hermeneutical analysis of source code are not established
- Source code of digital games, especially such being 30 years old, can be hard to come by
- Archiving and working academically with source code is an approach in the becoming
