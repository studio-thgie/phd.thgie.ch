# Oral History

## Notes Workshop July 2023
- Strong relation to the people
- transnational analysis
- how to identify key players and bring that together
- ==Trust!== is very important
- What are representative amounts of samples?
- Memory bias & fallibility, as well as manipulation can be a problem
- it's important to balance the sample to not reproduce certain things
- how to deal with legacy is an interesting question
- Process of an oral history interview: preparing > conducting > analyse
- Preparing
	- Spot someone relevant and get information
	- find the neutral-ish tone and then act like a mirror
	- a guide composed of themes, according to your situation
- Conducting
	- Oral history is a negociation
	- again: build trust and set expectations
	1. Setting: where to do the interview. Look for environments that support the interview in different ways; at ease, materially relevant to questions. ==all settings are socially situated and contain power relations==
	2. Material: Interview Guide, note material, recorder
	3. Conversation:
		- Researcher is a listener
		- the participant is the talker
	4. Ending the Interview
		- Saturation point ~1h
		- Follow-up
		- Write memo (context)
		- Transcribe asap
- Open ended questions can also be overwhelming
- "Interviews are like pancakes, the first one is always kind of wasted"
- Analysing Interviews with GTM
	- focus on experience
	- new theories through indiction
	- parallel organisation of research
	- Coding interviews: Factual data and personal experience (of the participant)
	- Coding involves creating props and figuring out how to relate to each others
