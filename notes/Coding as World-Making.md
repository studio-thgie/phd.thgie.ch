# Coding as World-Making

“Given the role of knowledge production in world making, digital humanities can be understood as a world-making project as well. In his controversial article “Hello Worlds,” which argues that humanities students should learn how to code, Matthew Kirschenbaum describes programming as “a unique and startling way of looking at the world . . . in fact, a kind of world-making.”38 The coder becomes the world maker, charged with defining the rules and characteristics of the world, articulating “the behaviors of an object or a system from the ground up.”39 This apt description of programming evinces the colonial dynamics of knowledge production, akin to Edward Said’s contention that Orientalist scholarship almost invented the “Orient” for Europe.40 Kirschenbaum’s description of world making also evokes the processes of knowledge creation in digital humanities. He argues that “programming is about choices and constraints, and about how you choose to model some select slice of the world around you in the formal environment of the computer.”41 The world making of programming, for Kirschenbaum, is intimately linked to producing humanities knowledge. The building blocks of syntax, actions, subjects, and objects are elements that create both computer models of the world and the plots of literature alike.42 In defining “world,” Kirschenbaum is careful to distinguish between the world of the program and the world around us: a world is “something very much like a model, a selective and premeditated representation of reality, where some elements of the real are emphasized and exaggerated, others are distorted and caricatured, still others are absent altogether.”” (Risam, 2019, p. 33)

“Therefore, world making in digital humanities fosters the proliferation of many worlds, reflecting what Kirschenbaum describes as how “reality can be sliced and sampled in an infinite variety of ways.”44 This raises the question, however, of whether these worlds are reproducing the hegemonies of the “real” world and whether other worlds are possible.” (Risam, 2019, p. 33)
