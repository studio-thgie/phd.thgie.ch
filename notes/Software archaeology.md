# Software archaeology
> Software archaeology, named by analogy with archaeology, includes the reverse engineering of software modules, and the application of a variety of tools and processes for extracting and understanding program structure and recovering design information. Software archaeology may reveal dysfunctional team processes which have produced poorly designed or even unused software modules, and in some cases deliberately obfuscatory code may be found. - [Software archaeology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_archaeology)
