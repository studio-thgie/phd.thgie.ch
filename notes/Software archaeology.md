# Software archaeology
> Software archaeology, named by analogy with archaeology, includes the reverse engineering of software modules, and the application of a variety of tools and processes for extracting and understanding program structure and recovering design information. Software archaeology may reveal dysfunctional team processes which have produced poorly designed or even unused software modules, and in some cases deliberately obfuscatory code may be found. - [Software archaeology - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_archaeology)

I choose to use this term as a general approach for getting to the source code of software (or video games), which can include processes such as accessing disk dumps, decompiling or disassembling executable software, peeking into running software with extra tools and so forth. The main goal for software archaeology is to "dig up" the origins and inner workings of the software one is looking at.
