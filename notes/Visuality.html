        <h1 id="visuality">Visuality</h1>
        <p>In using the term visuality I depend on the definitions
        brought forward by Gillian Rose and Paolo Favero. Here,
        visuality refers to the socio-cultural construction of how and
        what we see (Rose, 2016). I’m building on these descriptions as
        I am mainly interested in the image as a medium of
        communication, a semiotic device that attempts to transport
        meaning, and using rhetorics to transform intentions into
        affects. Coming from design rhetorics, I am interested in how
        designers and developers of games encoded meaning and rhetoric
        into the images, as well as the effects of these onto the
        players. Gillian Rose herself is building upon the work by Hal
        Foster, who defined visuality as the “how we see, how we are
        able, allowed, or made to see, and how we see this seeing and
        the unseeing therein”. This relates the term visuality to the
        slightly more complex scopic regime (Jay, 2008).</p>

        Visuality in digital games</h2>
        <p>As in every other medium, the visuality in digital games has
        its own specifics. Being of high relevancy to this dissertation,
        I’ll try to outline two of them in the following: ergodicity and
        techno-historic limits.</p>
        <p>Digital games are especially demanding of their consumers as
        the medium relies on a high level of participation. The
        difference between reading a book, watching a film or playing a
        digital game was especially well captured by Espen Aarseth’s
        application of ergodicity in his book Cybertext. Coming from
        literature studies, Aarseth speaks of a “nontrivial effort
        [that] is required to allow the reader to traverse the text”
        (Aarseth, 1997). This needed effort does not guarantee an
        exhaustive capture of the played game or a successful
        play-through. The player creates a path through the
        configuration of a textual machine, by participating in the
        game.</p>
        <p>This ergodicity is an important aspect when considering the
        image visible on the screen. The image represents one possible
        state, defined by the elements that the designers of the game
        provided, configured by the player’s participation. At the same
        moment, the image on screen communicates choices for the player,
        who then can reconfigure it by acting within the game. The image
        holds its own future possibilities by being within a feedback
        loop between itself and the player. The above outlined process
        happens in parallel to the communicative features of the image,
        which can also speak of information relevant to the game’s
        state, such as highscores or player lives, as well as
        transporting narratives that are creating context and experience
        for the player.</p>
        <p>The second aspect of heightened relevance is the relationship
        between the image and its technological structures, from which
        it springs forth. Being digital born, the image in digital games
        is depending on hardware and software in order to be seen. These
        can be considered the material aspect of visuality in digital
        games. Analog to Aarseth’s coining of cybertext, Stefan Möring
        applies the term cyberimage to denote the images dependance on
        its underlying technological structures as well as the player’s
        interaction with the machine (Gerling et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>Todays digital games playing devices are powerful computers
        and myriad of softwares and frameworks aid in the development
        and design. Game development in the early days of game design
        looked quite different. The capabilities of computers were
        fairly limited and the technical realisation of the games had to
        be done in early programming languages, such as Basic or even
        Assembler dialects. This circumstances form the techno-historic
        limits of early digital game design and directly influenced
        formal and semiotic aspects of those games’ visuality
        (Hutchison, 2008). These limits as well as the intimate
        interplay between the technological foundation as a semiotic
        system in itself and the visible image will be considered in
        this dissertation through the application of critical code
        analysis (Marino, 2020).</p>
