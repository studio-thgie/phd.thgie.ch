# Metadata
If I'm not mistaken, not to much has been done on the subject of image metadata ontologies specifically for video games. It would be interesting to develop some templates for Tropy. In general I see that there is some work to be done here that I could use for my dissertation.

## Ontologies and Frameworks
- [The Video Game Ontology](http://vocab.linkeddata.es/vgo/)
- [Framework for the Analysis of Visual Representation in Video Games](https://www.ludov.ca/index.php/en/observation/graphical-technologies/game-favr)

## Ontology and Metadata Tools and Platforms
- [OntoME](https://ontome.net/)
- [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)
- [Nodegoat](https://nodegoat.net/)
- [Geovistory](https://www.geovistory.org/)

I haven't found out yet, what platform would be the best. But maybe the answer is related to the research problem/question.
