        <p><a href="notes/Critical%20Code%20Analysis.html">Critical Code
        Analysis</a> treats code not only as functional but as a
        cultural artefact written by and for humans, as text. But to
        what extend can it be treated as text? Is text in a literary
        sense or does it lean rather towards text in Foucauldian sense,
        as in something that can be read and analysed towards
        meaning?</p>
        <p>In my tests on using <a
        href="notes/Distant%20Reading%20the%20VICE%20Source%20Code.html">Distant
        Reading the VICE Source Code</a> I figured on of the biggest
        problems to be the non-linearity of sourcecode. There is no
        clear beginning and no clear and, instead, sourcecode is highly
        networked and referential. Parts are included and reused,
        moduralized and broken up into pieces. That makes it pretty
        tough to read linear patterns from it, as the sourcecode is not
        sortable.</p>
