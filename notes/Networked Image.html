        <blockquote>
        <p>CSNI understands that the “networked image” is at the centre
        of a new global mode of reproduction and representation in which
        the visual image is paramount. We realise that what constitutes
        an image has been radically transformed, and with it the
        theories that allow us to study it. Although we have to date
        largely followed a historicity based on the photograph, we
        recognise the anachronism, and the need for an enlarged scope
        that can account for the image as a dynamic, distributed and
        computational object that unsettles received notions of
        space-time — no longer limited to traditional representation
        (what media artist and theorist Harun Farocki has called
        “operative image”<em>), and no longer necessarily visual at all.
        In using the term “networked image” — preferring it to operative
        image (or even post-photography) — we aim to emphasise the
        network as a descriptor of dynamic social relations as much as
        technological infrastructure.<strong> Moreover our aim is to
        broaden the discussion of the networked image as a relational <a
        href="notes/Assemblage.html">assemblage</a> to address planetary
        scale computation, the politics of infrastructure, and wider
        ecologies that would include non-human entities and
        environmental concerns.</strong></em> - <a
