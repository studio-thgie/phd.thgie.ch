# Assemblage

> “DeLanda defines assemblages as ‘wholes whose properties emerge from the interactions between parts’.” ([Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 668](zotero://select/library/items/D5S5C3ZS))

Assemblages have kinship with the concept of [intertextuality](notes/Intertextuality.md). An Assemblage is fluid. It’s part can exist on their own and become parts of other or multiple assemblages.
