# How to Research Gap and Question

## Research Gap
> A **research problem** is a specific issue or gap in existing knowledge that you aim to address in your research. You may choose to look for practical problems aimed at contributing to change, or theoretical problems aimed at expanding knowledge.

## Research Question
-   **Focused** on a single problem or issue
-   **Researchable** using [primary and/or secondary sources](https://www.scribbr.com/working-with-sources/primary-and-secondary-sources/)
-   **Feasible** to answer within the timeframe and practical constraints
-   **Specific** enough to answer thoroughly
-   **Complex** enough to develop the answer over the space of a paper or thesis
-   **Relevant** to your field of study and/or society more broadly
