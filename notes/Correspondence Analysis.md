> “The typological approach is one way to question conceptions about texts, readers, and the limits of such concepts. Its reductionist perspective makes it easy to check, criticize, modify, or even reject if necessary. The larger categories attained by this method explain themselves through their construction, and the problem of industrial-rhetorical terminology that haunts so much of the current theoretical discussions of the new media can thereby, we hope, be avoided. The same approach could probably be used in other typological studies of cultural phenomena, such as the study of literary genres. The open categories approach also allows for a prediction of hypothetical textual modes, by combining functions that are not found together in any existing texts.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 81)
