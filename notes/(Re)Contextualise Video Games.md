# (Re)Contextualise Video Games

What is important when contextualising a video game.

- public profile
- geographical, political and cultural context
- material aspects
- link to other interests
- evolution of a genre or mechanique
- the place in which the game was played
- how did the game landscape look like at the time of publishing
- distribution or aquiring method
- promoting language
