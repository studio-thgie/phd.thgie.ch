# Intertextuality

> ‘meaning in a text can only ever be understood in relation to other texts; no work stands alone but is interlinked with the tradition that came before it and the context in which it is produced’ (Allen, 2000, p. i)

> "Put simply, and if we adapt the theory to video games, games can only be understood in relation to other video games. […] This argument could be pushed further. One could add that derivatives from games – such as ports, rereleases, emulation and fan fictions – use their direct ancestor, the original version, as intertext. The concept of intertextuality also accounts for the influences of other sources. ‘The systems, codes and traditions of other art forms and of culture in general are also crucial to the meaning of a work of literature’ (Allen, 2000, p. 1). In other words, to truly understand literature, or in this case video games, one must also look to other media that influence the design and creation of the games. Like text, video games are not only influenced by other games but also by culture and other art forms." (Guay-Bélanger, “Assembling Auras.”)
