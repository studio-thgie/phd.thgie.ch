        <hr />
        <p>Video games are manifestations of designerly intentions,
        which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into an
        output. People of all trades, from code to graphics, thus
        transform their knowledge and skills into a playable and
        meaningful experience. But as cultural products, video games
        communicate much more than these intentioned designs. They also
        capture unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and
        ideologies, as well as historical contexts.</p>
        <p>This is equally true for the visuality of the video game, on
        which this proposal is concentrating. To analyse this, I will
        present an approach of critical reading of the transformation of
        code to images (rewrite this part after <a
        href="literature/fizekLudicGlassMaking2022.html">Sonia Fizek’s
        text</a>). Drawing on critical code analysis and design
        rethorics, I combine methodologies from design research and the
        digital humanities. Critical readings serve the purpose of
        unearthing and dissecting power structures and the generation of
        meaning in and from our cultural artefacts. Such readings open
        up our research objects to a plethora of interpretations.</p>
        <p>The images in video games differ from paintings or
        photographs. They are not materially fixed in time-space, but
        again and again computed, reacting on interaction and changes in
        the game state. If we take a closer look at the image of video
        games and accept it as an artefact that is calculated and
        constructed by code and computer hardware, we must conclude that
        the underlying technology is formative for its discourse and
        meaning. Respectively, that programmers and graphic designers
        alike are significantly involved in the circulation and
        formation of meanings and power relations through the image in
        video games.</p>
        <p>In my approach assume a hitherto invisible rift between the
        research on the image of the digital game and its material base.
        The image of digital games brings with its own specificities.
        The constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from
        the hardware’s calculation. It is interactive and as such holds
        within itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing
        itself upon the player’s input. Research on the image of digital
        games more often than not focuses either on the constituted and
        visible image, or its material basis – either on visuality or
        technology.</p>
        <p>Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        digital game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent
        from digital humanities, design research and video game studies
        and assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical
        reading the visuality of digital games.</p>
