        <p>The attribution of nationality to a creative work seems like
        a common act. An author born in Switzerland and writing about
        Switzerland clearly produces Swiss texts, it seems? This
        attribution has to be seen critically and reframed as claiming
        within nationalism of old and new alike. Nations are not a given
        natural fact, but the results of negotiations within political
        agendas. Attribution of nationality then, as in <em>country of
        origin</em>, is a political and selective act to establish
        specific political narratives.</p>
        <p>Digital games are produced by networks of actants, as many
        other modern creative works – developer studios, publishers,
        programmers, graphic artists, writers, and so on. Any of these
        as well as the content of the game could be used towards and
        attribution of nationality. But, what exactly makes a digital
        game being a specific nationality? When investigated in detail,
        such choices can seem random and underline rather a political
        narrative than a factuality.</p>
        <p>This dissertation project inquires into the complexity of
        ascribing nationality to digital games in early games attributed
        to Switzerland. The research focus lies on the visuality, the
        image on screen and paratextual material. Images can be
        deliberately inscribed with nationalism or read towards
        involuntarily traces of such. Either way, they can be
        investigated towards meaningful findings regarding the outlined
        complexity in this dissertation project.</p>
        <p>I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the research on
        the image of the digital game and its material base. The image
        of digital games brings with its own specificities. The
        constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from the
        hardware’s calculation. It is interactive and as such holds
        within itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing
        itself upon the player’s input. Research on the image of digital
        games more often than not focuses either on the constituted and
        visible image, or its material basis – either on visuality or
        technology.</p>
        <p>Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        digital game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent
        from digital humanities, design research and video game studies
        and assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical
        reading the visuality of digital games.</p>
