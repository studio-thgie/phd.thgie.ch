        <p>Video games are manifestations of designerly intentions,
        which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into a
        product. People of all trades, from code to graphics, thus
        transform their knowledge and skills into a playable and
        meaningful experience. But as cultural products, video games
        communicate much more than these design intentions. They also
        integrate unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and
        ideologies.</p>
        <p>This is equally true for the visuality of the video game, on
        which this proposal is concentrating. To analyse this, I will
        present an approach to a critical and close reading of the
        transformation of code to images. Drawing on critical code
        analysis and design rethorics, I combine methodologies from
        design research and the digital humanities. Critical readings
        serve the purpose of unearthing and dissecting power structures
        and the generation of meaning in and from our cultural
        artefacts. Such readings open up our research objects to a
        plethora of interpretations.</p>
        <p>The images in video games differ from paintings or
        photographs. They are not materially fixed in time-space, but
        procedurally generated in the moment of play. If we take a
        closer look at the image of video games and accept it as an
        artefact that is calculated and constructed by code and computer
        hardware, we must conclude that the underlying technology is
        formative for its discourse and meaning. Respectively, that
        programmers and graphic designers alike are significantly
        involved in the circulation and formation of meanings and power
        relations through the image in video games.</p>
        <p>Research on the visuality of video games largely ignores the
        interplay and interconnection of visuality and its technological
        underlayer. There seems to be a hard to bridge gap, a momentum
        where the description of images is transformed into the
        visuality of video games. It’s a moment where meaning is
        transfered from one system of signifiers (code) into another
        (visuality), from one sphere of disciplines to another. This
        calls for an approach depending on interactional expertise.
        Coming from design research I am interested into how these two
        spheres are part of a whole, being created by people with
        intentions and having effects.</p>
        <p>In my approach assume a hitherto invisible rift between the
        research on the image of the digital game and its material base.
        The image of digital games brings with its own specificities.
        The constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from
        the hardware’s[^1] calculation. It is interactive and as such
        holds within itself a plurality of different futures,
        actualizing itself upon the player’s input. Research on the
        image of digital games more often than not focuses either on the
        constituted and visible image, or its material basis – either on
        visuality or technology.</p>
        <p>Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        digital game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent
        from digital humanities, design research and video game studies
        and assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical
        reading the visuality of digital games.</p>
