- 5 Slides, 5 minutes
- 1. slide: introduction [name, logos]
	- background (design research HKB, diss Uni Bern, ludens)
- 2. slide: dissertation subject [ball raider]
	- image, resp. visuality in video games
	- what's on it, why does it exist, how was it made, what does it mean
	- transformation of code (hardware instructions) to the image
	- game code and the resulting image are two halves of a proposed whole
- 3. slide: research objectives [street fighter]
	- Coding in order to produce the image in video games is a bimodal designerly activity
	- two aspects are situated in two completely different domains
	- interested in how programmers go about this bimodal activity, and, how they or their activity shape the discourse on visuality
	- further, interested in how these two modes interact or integrate
	- translation and transformation of meaning from one semantic system to another
- 4. slide: methods [code and image object]
	- video game studies treat games as texts after the approach of Foucault; lots and lots of critical reading 
	- critical code analysis; which treats code not only as functional but as a cultural artefact written by and for humans
	- design rhetoric and discourse analysis; code and visuality are conscious and unconscious designed with intention towards specific affects
	- HGP-Method; relying on paratextual material, the social dimension and the historicity of these games
- 5. slide: outro [necronom]
	- young project no findings;
	- do some research, come by and play Necronom, a game from our corpus
