        with Amiga Floppy Disks in Historical Video Game Research</h1>
        <p><img src="assets/IMG_3130.png" /></p>
        <p>Like most humanity scholars and historians, we ((As in the
        Confoederatio Ludens research team)) work with historical
        materials that we compile into a corpus. How does this approach
        apply to researching digital-born media, such as video games
        designed for the Amiga computing system?</p>
        <p>When inquiring older digital games, the question of
        authenticity ((With regard to how a game should be played to
        deliver the intended experience.)) quickly arises. Playing a
        game is an integral part in my research process. Even if just
        briefly, I want to be in the feedback loop created by myself,
        the machine and the game. It helps me get a feeling for the game
        at hand and what it might encompass.</p>
        <p>However, when dealing with games designed for deprecated or
        obsolete hardware, I consider the impact of the playing
        environment on my research. Is it crucial to experience the game
        with the original joystick? Is it acceptable to run the game on
        an emulator, viewing it through a 3.5” display? What role did
        the materiality of the original hardware play, including the
        sounds it produced, in shaping the player’s experience?</p>
        <p>Playing a game on an emulator is time-efficient, but can’t
        reproduce all the aspects of playing in the original
        environment. Many digital games have already been copied from
        their physical media, such as floppy disks, and archived on
        informal online platforms, like the infamous <a
        href="https://www.whdload.de">WHDLoad</a>. It’s a simple matter
        of matching the appropriate emulator software with the
        downloaded game files, and you’re ready to go. Working with the
        original hardware is considerably more resource-intensive. You
        need to locate the appropriate hardware, purchase it (hoping it
        still functions), transport it, and find storage space, not to
        mention the ongoing maintenance. In turn, you might get aspects,
        that playing the game on an emulator left out.</p>
        <p>Long story short, we wanted to have both. We wanted to play
        the games we are researching on emulators as well as the
        original hardware.</p>
        <h2 id="amiga">Amiga</h2>
        <p><img src="assets/3d1b69ca7022aec4.png" /></p>
        <p>I recently acquired a complete Amiga 500 set, with a
        Commodore 1084 monitor, joysticks, and hundreds of floppy disks,
        primarily containing games. More information can be found in
        this <a
        href="https://hcommons.social/@thgie@post.lurk.org/110899431776662399">Mastodon
        post</a>. The Amiga was an immensely popular home computing
        system in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly for gaming. Among
        the games in this acquisition, two are relevant to our research
        project: an original version of <a
        href="https://swissgames.garden/games/ringside">Ringside</a> (1989)
        and a demo version of <a
        href="https://swissgames.garden/games/rolling-ronny">Rolling
        Ronny</a> (1991). Most of the other games we found in this disk
        collection are available online on the aforementioned informal
        archives and are currently of lesser importance to us, since
        they don’t relate to our research questions.</p>
        <p>Having an Amiga available in our game lab at the University
        of Bern inspired us to play some of the games from our corpus on
        the actual machine ((You can get a rough idea which games we’re
        interested in by visiting <a
        href="https://swissgames.garden/?release_year_range%5Bend%5D=2000">Swiss
        Games Garden</a>)). We aren’t necessarily focused on reviving
        questions of authenticity, but it’s undeniably enjoyable to
        explore different playing setups. It is as well helps in
        reflecting through the different gameplay experiences. All we
        needed were a USB-powered floppy drive and some blank floppy
        disks—or so we thought.</p>
        <p>In a brief search for software to read or write Amiga floppy
        disks, I discovered that the challenge lies at the hardware
        level. At that point, we already had a “modern” USB-driven
        floppy drive, which was rendered useless for our purposes.
        Different floppy drive systems employ distinct methods of
        encoding data on the disk, involving varying reading and writing
        patterns. This process is controlled by hardware and cannot be
        altered by software.</p>
        <p>What we required was old hardware capable of connecting to
        new hardware…</p>
        <h2 id="greaseweazle">Greaseweazle</h2>
        <p>Fortunately, I was not the first to confront this issue.
        Several existing projects tackle the problem. Established
        examples that address reading and writing old computing system
        floppies include <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KryoFlux">KryoFlux</a> and <a
        href="https://wernli.pages.in2p3.fr/pauline-doc/en/">Pauline</a>.
        I opted for <a
        href="https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle">Greaseweazle</a>,
        which appeared to be a popular and readily accessible choice
        within the Amiga enthusiast community ((Like on the <a
        href="https://eab.abime.net/search.php?searchid=27635744">English
        Amiga Board</a> or in the <a
        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/search/?q=greaseweazle">r/Amiga
        Subreddit</a>)). Greaseweazle is a compact circuit board that
        connects older floppy drives to modern computers running
        contemporary operating systems via USB. I swiftly ordered the
        device from an online shop specializing in spare parts and
        extensions for the Amiga system ((Greaseweazle V4 on the <a
        href="https://amigastore.eu/en/894-greaseweazle-v4.html">AMIGAstore</a>)).</p>
        <p>Acquiring an older floppy drive turned out to be somewhat
        more challenging. Greaseweazle can accommodate numerous
        different drives, from those used in the Commodore 64 and Amiga
        to those found in desktop towers running Windows or a Unix
        derivative. These drives are not ubiquitous on the second-hand
        market, but at least relatively common and affordable, typically
        priced around 10.- CHF. To establish a functional setup, I also
        needed power and data cables, which is when most of the sellers
        I contacted started to ghost me. I didn’t just want the drive; I
        also needed the necessary cables. Many sellers either didn’t
        possess these cables or were unwilling to expend the effort to
        locate them, at least not at the price they were offering the
        drives. Scouring various second-hand stores and cash converters
        yielded no results either.</p>
        <p>Finally, I located a seller in the opposite corner of
        Switzerland who was willing to provide both the drive and the
        cables.</p>

        src="assets/IMG_3132.png" /></p>
        <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
        <p>Once I assembled all the necessary components, the rest
        proceeded smoothly. Installing the required command-line tools
        for macOS was straightforward, thanks to the well-documented <a
        href="https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle/wiki">Greaseweazle
        Wiki</a>. I would like to delve further into this aspect, but
        reading and writing was so effortless, I would just end up
        repeating the Wiki. Feeling comfortable with the command line
        helps a lot, although the overall process isn’t to complicated.
        Problems might arise, if a user is not to familiar with the
        terminal environment. There are also several graphical
        interfaces for Windows ((For example <a
        href="https://desertsagesolutions.com/greaseweazlegui/">GreaseweazleGUI</a>
        or <a
        href="https://github.com/FrankieTheFluff/FluxMyFluffyFloppy">FluxMyFluffyFloppy</a>)),
        which I didn’t test.</p>
        <p>What intrigued me more was the minor ordeal I underwent to
        obtain the appropriate hardware, despite it not being
        excessively old. It began with the realization that a newer
        USB-driven floppy drive wouldn’t suffice and extended to
        visiting every second-hand shop in my area. Floppy disks still
        exist, but there are only a few individuals who truly care about
        this technology, aside from specialized archivists and
        enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>This challenge doesn’t affect us alone. Game preservation
        faces a distinct window of opportunity, not only due to the
        limited availability of key technologies on the market but also
        because these technologies rely on peripheral components like
        out-of-market cables, among others. Consequently, there’s an
        urgent need to establish efficient procedures to aid in the
        preservation of ageing video games. It is important to swiftly
        establish structures to facilitate the rescue of these cultural
        artefacts.</p>
        <p>For our research project, this technology is invaluable. We
        rely on it to extract data from floppy disks, preserve them, and
        share them with our fellow researchers. Additionally, it allows
        us to play dumped games on the original hardware. Consequently,
        we need to acquire the necessary knowledge and infrastructure to
        set up and maintain such systems. Maintenance will be a journey
        for another day. For now, I enjoy the ease of use that the
        current setup brings to our research process.</p>
