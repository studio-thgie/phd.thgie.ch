# Design Rhetoric
Design rhetoric examines the rhetorical principles in designed artefacts regarding their effects.

The following will be carried out by experienced designers with their own practical experience

1. recording the formal and functional characteristics of the artefact to be examined (in the vocabulary of design practice)
2. bringing together the observed characteristics with the presumed effective goals (production-aesthetic assumptions)
3. (Targeted discussion of the assumptions in the research team and) investigation of the antagonistic effects.
4. processing of the conflicting goals and, if necessary, development of counter-proposals.

The Bernese model of design rhetorics strongly links to Richard Buchanan design as argument, which he wrote about in “Declaration by Design”. There, he makes the following links between rhetorics and the designed.

- Logos - technological argument; tech. Conditions and human. Needs come together; natural and social sciences
- Ethos - character; reflection of the designer through the product; ethics and politics
- Pathos: emotion; art and aesthetics
