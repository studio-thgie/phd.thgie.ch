        <h1 id="openrefine-and-wikidata">OpenRefine and Wikidata</h1>
        <p>This entry is a work in progress and will be expanded in the
        future.</p>
        <p>I worked extensively with OpenRefine in order to import the
        CH-part of our <a
        href="https://spielkult.hypotheses.org/3999">list of digital
        games from the German-speaking countries</a> into Wikidata.
        OpenRefine feels a bit like a batch-tool for spreadsheets. It’s
        main purpose is to cleanup and transform spreadsheet data. It
        also has this fantastic connection to Wikidata, enabling the
        user to reconciliate (compare and link) spreadsheet data to
        entries on Wikidata. After cleanup and reconciliation you then
        can import your data to Wikidata.</p>
        <p>This <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfS1qTKFQoI">OpenRefine
        Beginners Tutorial</a> gave me a good verview on the basics of
        OpenRefine.</p>
        <p>After some tryouts, my process looked like this:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Import prepared Google spreadsheet into OpenRefine</li>
        <li>Split columns where necessary, ie if the platform or
        developer column contained several comma-separated values. For
        the reconciliation, a column can only contain one value.</li>
        <li>Reconciliate the data you want to import. Most importantly
        the game title column. This one links your row of information to
        the entry on Wikidata.</li>
        <li>Built your Wikidata schema of the things you want to import.
        This is a crucial step and can be messy, ie you have the game
        developer attribute, but not all the developers in your data
        exist on Wikidata yet. That might lead to the creation of said
        developers on Wikidata, but their not automatic reconciliated in
        your local data. If you don’t reconciliate and import again, the
        developer might be created again and you have a duplicate on
        Wikidata.</li>
        <li>Import your data. That works mostly fine, but I run into a
        problem when trying to import some new attributes to already
        existing entries. When no single value was present in a row and
        it tried to import it anyway, OpenRefine got stuck.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Especially the fourth step is very important to take care of.
        I organised it such that all linked entries are created first.
        If I have the attribute developers in my video game scheme, I
        see that all the mentioned developers exist already on Wikidata.
        That means that before the main import, you might want to build
        and import a developing people schema first.</p>
