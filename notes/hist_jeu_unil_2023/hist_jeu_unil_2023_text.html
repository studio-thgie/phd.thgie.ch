        Attack - A video game as rhetoric device in the political
        communication of the extreme right</h1>
        <p><em>Did Minarett Attack work as a rhetorical device during
        the referendum of 29 Nov. 2009 “Gegen den Bau von Minaretten”?
        How did it influence the political landscape of the

        <p>This blog post looks at the use of a video game in a
        political campaign from 2009 by a party on the extreme right.
        I’m looking at the game in question as a rhetoric device. Since
        the game can’t be played any more, I’ll analyse what the
        internet was able to preserve – press coverage as well as
        various media artefacts. This enables me to analyse the
        application of visual design rhetoric within the game, as well
        as the game’s reception in the press. Intention and effect are
        two important aspects for a rhetoric analysis <span

        <p>The Islamophobic Minarett Attack wasn’t my first choice. It
        certainly is not a video game I’m enjoying. But, after an
        initial analysis, I knew that contextualising and discussing the
        game was relevant. For my course project, I decided to start
        with a question: What are early examples of Swiss games that
        make or work as political statements. These days, in 2023 and
        especially in the indie game-scene, it is common to have games
        that interact with socio-political contexts <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="westecottIndependentGameDevelopment2013">(<strong>westecottIndependentGameDevelopment2013?</strong>)</span>.
        These games then work as lenses of local and global politics,
        indicating social processes and struggles. I intended to search
        for similar, but a bit farther back in time. I hoped to find
        video games that come from a leftist-activist corner, but,
        instead ended up with a game that was outspoken provoking
        through the depiction of racism.</p>
        <p>For my research, I targeted some of the larger video game
        specific databases, such as MobyGames or the UVL. I also tried
        some of the general knowledge platforms, such as Wikipedia and
        Google. My search inquiries were built through different
        combinations of the relevant keywords such as activism,
        politics, Switzerland, and others. Especially the relation to
        Switzerland was difficult and I didn’t find anything suitable.
        Either such games generally don’t exist, are not on record, or
        my research inquiry was too tight. Failing with querying
        databases, I resorted to manually go through the Swiss Games
        Garden database in search for fitting games, where I finally
        stumbled across Minarett Attack.</p>
        <p>Although it was not the kind of game I hoped for, it fitted
        my research question perfectly. Minarett Attack was launched in
        2009 by Goal AG during a political campaign of the SVP. The game
        was produced and published with the clear intention of making or
        working as a political statement and influence the political
        landscape.</p>
        <h2 id="description-and-context">Description and context</h2>
        <p>The game was developed<a href="/notes/hist_jeu_unil_2023/hist_jeu_unil_2023_text.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> by Alexander
        Segert at Goal AG in 2009. The marketing and communication
        agency has existed since at least 1979 and had always had ties
        to the political scene on the right. So did Segert<a href="/notes/hist_jeu_unil_2023/hist_jeu_unil_2023_text.html#fn2"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="/notes/hist_jeu_unil_2023/hist_jeu_unil_2023_text.html#fn3"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, who had taken over the
        agency long before the development of Minarett Attack. The game
        was developed to be part of a larger political project, the
        Swiss minaret referendum<a href="/notes/hist_jeu_unil_2023/hist_jeu_unil_2023_text.html#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, which wanted to
        forbid the building of new minarets in Switzerland. Another
        component of the campaign was a poster, also widely discussed in
        the press and the political landscape of Switzerland for its
        inherent depiction of racism.</p>
        <p>[Image of poster]</p>
        <p>Produced in Flash and published under its own domain
        minarett-attack.ch, the game fitted right into the emerging area
        of casual and shareable online games. For example, the famous
        and widely popular FarmVille was released the same year. An
        indication is a call-to-action button at the game’s end,
        inviting to share the game with “friends”, a term that Facebook
        popularised for social media. Adobe Flash was a tool for the
        creation of animations that could be shared online through the
        application of a browser plugin. It introduced the simple
        scripting language ActionScript later and enabled the creation
        of interactive media. Casual games became easy and affordable to
        realise. Although it is difficult to acquire social media
        content from 2009, there are still traces of Minarett Attack in
        the blogosphere of that time, indicating the circulation of
        references to the game.</p>
        <p>[Screenshot of empty screen]</p>
        <p>Starting the game, the player is welcomed by a simplified but
        idyllic depiction of Switzerland. We have a handful of Swiss
        monuments, the famous Swiss Alps as background and, above all,
        the sun. Little by little, minarets start to emerge. The player
        controls a little circle, with which he must aim at the towers.
        A mouse click “stops” the appearance. A low dong sound is
        hearable, and the circle transforms into a stop-sign. If one is
        too slow to stop the emergence of a tower, it rests in place and
        can’t be removed any more. Instead, muezzin appear, chanting
        their prayers. The player can now aim and “stop” them instead,
        gaining points in the process. Minarett Attack references
        established game mechanics, known since Duck Hunt or the in the
        German-speaking countries widely popular Mohrhuhn<a href="/notes/hist_jeu_unil_2023/hist_jeu_unil_2023_text.html#fn5"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>[Screenshot of filled screen]</p>
        <p>Being part of a larger political project in parallel with an
        equally provocative billboard campaign, the game generated a lot
        of press coverage. The FPÖ, an extreme right political party of
        Austria and another client of Goal AG, deemed the application of
        Minarett Attack successful. In the following year, they
        republished a customised version of the game during their
        election campaign. The game was rebranded as Moschee Baba and
        featured Austrian monuments instead of Swiss ones. Although
        beyond the scope of this text, I deem it important to state that
        Moschee Baba triggered much more serious discussion in Austria
        about the racism in the game and actually led to legal actions
        and political consequences<a href="/notes/hist_jeu_unil_2023/hist_jeu_unil_2023_text.html#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>I hope by now it should be clear, why I’m using the predicate
        Islamophobic to describe Minarett Attack.</p>
        <h2 id="analysis-and-findings">Analysis and findings</h2>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, the game can’t be played any more. The
        problem is of a technical nature. Adobe Flash output consists of
        a SWF file which can be embedded in a website, analogue to a
        video, for example. It was customary to keep the initial file
        small to ensure quick loading times. After a splash screen, the
        application would often load additional assets while displaying
        a loading bar to keep the visitor informed about the ongoing
        process. Minarett Attack was built this way, and while the
        Wayback Machine was able to capture the original site and
        initial SWF file, it did not preserve the additional assets that
        had to be loaded to play the game. I was capable of simulating
        some of the files in a mocked up environment, such as an
        additional file with text strings. But, I couldn’t reproduce
        another SWF, which probably held graphic assets and other
        important game files.</p>
        <p>In the following, I worked with media files I found dispersed
        over the internet. Especially screenshots were abundant, and I
        was able to locate two screen-recordings of the game, when
        extending my search with the follow-up game Moschee Baba. Since
        the game is rather simple and short, that provided more than
        enough material for the analysis of the visual aspects following
        a design rhetoric approach <span class="citation"
        data-cites="schnellerPerfektUnperfektElaboration2021">(Schneller
        2021)</span>. Being generally interested in how the game was
        applied in a communication strategy, it made sense to also
        analyse its reception. Regarding the possible workload such an
        analysis can bring with, I concentrated on creating context as
        well as how the game was perceived and described through the
        reading of a small selection of press articles from the
        German-speaking countries.</p>
        <p>A formal analysis of the game’s visuals must mention the
        apparent simplicity of the graphics. Adobe Flash used a vectored
        based graphics format, that is smaller in file size and can be
        optimised for quicker loading times. Flash games often had
        full-surface graphics, heavy leaning on gradients for colouring.
        A maybe unintentional by-product of this production technology
        is the emergence of a graphic style suitable for children’s
        books. Focusing on the different levels of details as well as
        the perspectives in the used graphics, I can assume that some of
        them were vector graphics assets gathered from elsewhere and
        some of them were produced for the game by the developer within
        Flash. Especially the difference between the minarets and the
        Swiss monuments are apparent.</p>
        <p>The symbolic meaning of the graphical elements in play are
        quickly assessed, but deserve a brief explanation. The Swiss
        flag, the alps, the Swiss monuments, and the sun create a
        nationalistic framing and an atmosphere of all is right. Other
        Swiss stereotypical icons, such as cows, cheese and pastures,
        were left out, indicating that the game targets an urban
        population. During gameplay, minarets start to appear,
        rocket-like, numerous and larger than the alps in the
        background. Meanwhile, the prayer of the muezzin overplays the
        idyllic music that was to be heard before. Clearly, an invasion
        is going on! One that takes over Switzerland’s pristine
        landscape and urban area. This depiction is an audiovisual
        representation of the Great Replacement conspiracy theory<a
        href="/notes/hist_jeu_unil_2023/hist_jeu_unil_2023_text.html#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, that existed in various
        forms since the 19th century, but was newly popularised in 2011.
        It can be assumed, that this depiction in Minarett Attack,
        points towards an ongoing discourse on the subject on the
        political right.</p>
        <p>Finally, I would like to mention, that with the specific
        depiction of the muezzin, the game inscribes itself into a long
        tradition of stereotypical racist illustrations of Islam and
        Muslims. This point alone is deserving of its own article, but
        is left out for now.</p>
        <p>The game itself is relatively devoid of direct messages. The
        game’s ending produces the following text:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Die Schweiz ist voller Minarette. Damit das nicht passiert:
        Am 29. November «JA zur Minarettverbots-Initiative»</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The same screen for Moschee Baba reads:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Die Steiermark ist voller Minarette und Moscheen! Damit das
        nicht geschieht: Am 26. September Dr. Gerhard Kurzmann und die
        FPÖ wählen!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Minarett Attack does not contain information about who is
        behind the campaign, whereas Moschee Baba links directly to the
        FPÖ. Both call for political action, framing the gameplay
        beforehand in a very specific manner. The intentions are clear,
        visually implemented, semantically contextualised. The game is
        entangled within a political framing, and for once, the
        connection between play and politics is not only not found
        problematic, but specifically requested <span class="citation"
        data-cites="pfisterPolitischeMythosAls2018">(Pfister
        2018)</span>.</p>
        <p>The discussion about the Anti-Minarett campaign’s inherent
        racism led many press outlets to mention them. The general focus
        was on the supposed scandal of such a campaign, without delving
        much on the details, mentioning poster and game. The discourse
        in the press intensified, when Moschee Baba ran into legal
        problems in Austria, concentrating on the implications for the
        involved people, such as Segert. Whereas the Swiss press simply
        covered the Anti-Minarett campaign, German left-leaning press,
        such as TAZ and the Süddeutsche, produced two longer articles
        that contextualise and cover the game in greater detail. Still,
        both articles reduce the game to a visual description and
        briefly mention the game mechanics.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Im Vordergrund sah man darin Schweizer Häuser, Brücken und
        Kirchtürme. Dahinter das Matterhorn, auf seinem Gipfel wehte

        <p>Focusing on the visuals equals reading the game akin to the
        posters, indicating a limited capacity of treating the game as
        its own media type. The posters were positioned in public space,
        passively consumed. The game was distributed and experienced in
        an entirely different manner, shared through informal and
        established social media online. I’m not a proponent of the idea
        that games incite violence. Still, the act of shooting minarets
        and Muslim brings with a different reception than the passive
        consumption of a poster. The game clearly plays with the Overton
        window<a href="/notes/hist_jeu_unil_2023/hist_jeu_unil_2023_text.html#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, a political theory that
        defines what one is allowed to say in political discourse. The
        game not only displays a radical right conspiracy theory, it
        also allows to active participation in the violent ridicule of a
        world religion and its believers.</p>
        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, Minarett Attack was a “success”. The
        Anti-Minarett initiative was voted into the constitution by the
        Swiss people by 57.5%. How much the game itself helped in
        winning that vote is difficult to capture. Understand how
        right-wing rhetoric works helps in this assessment. A major
        strategy of the right is gathering attention to be able to
        repeat their political statements over and over again <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="schutzbachRhetorikRechtenRechtspopulistische2018">(<strong>schutzbachRhetorikRechtenRechtspopulistische2018?</strong>)</span>.
        This ensures that the rights political agenda is imposed on the
        public and political discourse, forcing other political actors
        to react. This strategy can blow up issues of minor relevance
        and give them an undeserved priority or direction. That video
        games haven’t been taken serious further led to an inability to
        deal adequately with Minarett Attack and understand how a
        web-based game can sidetrack the public discourse.</p>
        <p>My research uncovered an internal document by the FPÖ
        Steiermark, anonymously authored on the 30th August 2010. The
        three-page document is mainly a FAQ on how to react to press
        inquiries about the game Moschee Baba. Justifications for the
        game link directly to the party’s political program about the
        supposed invasion of Islam. Questions about the violence against
        Islam in the game should be answered with the right to freedom
        of speech. I found nothing of this sort for Minarett Attack, but
        I can assume that the initiative committee and Goal AG prepared
        that campaign equally professional. The game enabled the
        political right in Switzerland and Austria to massively gain
        media attention, press coverage and discourse space in the
        public. The continued development and adaption of the game, in
        official versions as well as copies, clearly points towards the
        games’ effectivity for identification to the extreme right as
        well as a political tool that serves extreme right rhetoric and
        communication.</p>
        <p>I want to end on a more personal side. In my opinion,
        Minarett Attack is not only a commissioned work, done by a
        professional communication agency for a political party. Through
        contextualizing the game, I learned about the background of the
        developer, Alexander Segert. He was since early on part of the
        extreme right, warning in Islamophobic magazines about “the
        creeping infiltration of the Christian West by Islam”. This
        makes the creation of Minarett Attack a personal affair as well,
        a personally authored game <span class="citation"
        data-cites="siegelJeuAuteursBeginner2018">(<strong>siegelJeuAuteursBeginner2018?</strong>)</span>.
        Minarett Attack then becomes the amalgamation of an opportunity,
        the Anti-Minarett campaign, and personal convictions and the
        desire to express these. It is an ugly realisation, that a
        single person can have that much political influence through the
        development of a racist and Islamophobic game with graphics
        suitable for children’s books.</p>
        <p>I close with the question of how to deal with Minarett
        Attack’s legacy. Although it posited some difficulties, I’m
        happy that the game can’t be played any more. At the same time,
        I deem it important that the knowledge about this game’s
        existence and effects on the political landscape of Switzerland
        is preserved. But how does one preserve such a game, and its
        context, and not just reducing it to metadata? I can’t decide
        myself how we handle our past and ongoing racism. This needs to
        be a public discourse. Opening up the video games studies
        perspective on this specific game might be a first step.</p>

        repeatedly mentioned as the developer of the game, not just

        Szene in der Schweiz. In den 90er-Jahren war er Mitglied der
        rechten Psychosekte VPM, später hat er für mehrere rechte
        Publikationen geschrieben, vor allem für die erzkonservative
        Zeitung Schweizerzeit. Sein Chef dort war Ulrich Schlüer, der
        jetzt die Anti-Minarett-Initiative mitgegründet hat.” (Scheidt,
