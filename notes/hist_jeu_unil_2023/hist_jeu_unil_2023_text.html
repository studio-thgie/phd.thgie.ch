        Attack and the Overton window - A video game as rhetoric device
        in the political communication of the extreme right</h1>
        <p><em>Did Minarett Attack work as a rhetorical device during
        the referendum of 29 Nov. 2009 “Gegen den Bau von Minaretten”?
        How did it influence the political landscape of the
        time?</em></p>

        <ul>
        <li>Although changes in the academic landscape are observable,
        up to this day, video games struggle with being taken seriously,
        especially by the broader public.</li>
        <li>That video games haven’t been taken serious led to an
        inability to deal adequately with Minarett Attack</li>
        <li>Minarett Attack is an islamophobic game that played with the
        Overtone window</li>

        <li>Developed by Goal in 2009 within the context of the
        political campaign by SVP, but only loosly associated with the

        <li>Discussion
        <ul>
        <li>The game in question was used to trigger attention in order
        to get media time and being able to over and over repeat their
        political agenda</li>
        <li>The continued development and adaption of the game, in
        official versions as well as copies, points towards the games
        effectivity for identification on the extreme right as well as a
        political tool that serves extrem right rhetorics and
        communication</li>
