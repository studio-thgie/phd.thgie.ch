The last few days I was thinking about Minarett Attack and extrem right rhetoric today and came up with some theses.

- That video games haven't been taken serious led to an inability to deal adequately with Minarett Attack
- The game in question was used to trigger attention in order to get media time and being able to over and over repeat their political agenda
- The continued development and adaption of the game, in official versions as well as copies, points towards the games effectivity for identification on the extreme right as well as a political tool that serves extrem right rhetorics and communication

- Some notes before starting to decide what to work through and write up:
	- **Did Minarett Attack work as a rhetorical device during the referendum of 29 Nov. 2009 "Gegen den Bau von Minaretten"? How did it influence the political landscape of the time?**
	- First occurence on Wayback Machine 21 Oct. 2009, 
	- First ocurence moschee-baba.at on Wayback Machine 2. Sept 2010, published by FPÖ and later by alpen-donau.ch
		- [Anti Mosque Game for protection freedom - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMauUUS610)
	- First occurence call-of-muezzin.info on Wayback Machine 5. Jan 2011, published by DeutschlandEcho, but seems to be a redo of the original
		- [Minarett Attack – Metapedia](https://de.metapedia.org/wiki/Minarett_Attack)
	- It wasn't tied to a party or political goal (but had a message at the end of how many Minaretts there were in Austria (Switzerland?))
	- It was developed by the house agency of SVP/UDC
	- The background graphics were exchanged to include landmarks of the respective countries
- Todos
	- Analyse gameplay, mechanics, graphics and visuality
	- Analyse discourse around game in press and political statements (using the press coverage the game uses to repeat their points about too many Minaretts)
- Analysis of game
	- Gameplay and mechanics
		- Mouse moves around circle that needs to be placed over targets. Mouse press "stops" the target, meaning, remove them from the screen
		- Towers need to be removed while appearing. if not they will stay and the tower counter goes up, meaning you loose a life. 
		- The people appearing on the staying towers will not interefer with gameplay. "stopping" them gives points.
		- The game ends if enough towers stay or the timer runs out.
	- Sounds
		- Muezzin who rest start to pray
		- The towers make constructing sounds when appearing and a deeper dong when stay
		- CoM
			- plays the German hymn
			- the "stopping" uses a shooting sounds
		- Moschee Baba
			- play some Ländler in the background
			- the stopping sounds like a generic rustling click sound
	- Graphics
		- The background graphics were exchanged to include landmarks of the respective countries
			- Which landmarks were used?
		- MA and MB use otherwise the same assets, CoM has a lot of the graphics exchanged (towers, people) and also the vectorization style
- Rhetorics
	- It's not about discourse or conviction, but generating media attention and being able to repeat one's message (classic right wing rhetorics)
- How was the publishing landscape in 2009 (web made sense because everybody can share and link)

Decided to concentrate on Minarett Attack. There is not much to gain from a comparison of the two games, not as far as I can see. The focus on racism doesn't hold up, because one is racist, the other one reflects on it. But I have a hunch, that concentrating on the aspect of video game versus print campaign, as well as the games internationality. I want to try to get the game running as a next step. But it's simply not possible. The main.swf tries to load MinaretAttach.swf (observe the spelling mistake). I will have to stick to what I'll find online. I will make a large collection of pressmaterial, and try to sort out things that engage more with the game and not just the scandals around Moschee Baba and the FPÖ and Segert and alpen-donau.info.

## Minarett Attack
- developed by Alexander Segert (Goal AG), 2010
- is broken and can't be played online anymore; it's flash based and i guess after the initial load, the swf tries to get additional assets from a server, that's not online anymore (malformed language.xml, which is returning another domain's html content)
- i did found some video material and it is very well covered by press, because of the people's involvement in right-wing politics and some minor scandals
- brought developer Alexander Segert almost into prison

## DiscriminationPong
- developed by René Bauer, Beat Suter and Mirjam Weder, 2010
- still playable in different version (swf, html, mac/windows); extensively documented
- not extensively covered by press, as far as I can see at the moment (2023-11-22); found some blog posts
- there is an article co-written by René Bauer
- description
	- more or less classic pong. maybe slightly updated graphics. main changes are introduced through rules and game mechanics, whereas the left player is always disadvantaged
