        it influence the gamescape?</li>
        <li>how do we talk (publicly) about difficult games as this, how
        do we treat such games in terms of heritage and

        <p>The last few days I was thinking about Minarett Attack and
        extrem right rhetoric today and came up with some theses.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>That video games haven’t been taken serious led to an
        inability to deal adequately with Minarett Attack</li>
        <li>The game in question was used to trigger attention in order
        to get media time and being able to over and over repeat their
        political agenda</li>
        <li>The continued development and adaption of the game, in
        official versions as well as copies, points towards the games
        effectivity for identification on the extreme right as well as a
        political tool that serves extrem right rhetorics and
        communication</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="2023-11-28">2023-11-28</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Some notes before starting to decide what to work through
        and write up:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Did Minarett Attack work as a rhetorical device
        during the referendum of 29 Nov. 2009 “Gegen den Bau von
        Minaretten”? How did it influence the political landscape of the
        time?</strong></li>

        <li>It wasn’t tied to a party or political goal (but had a
        message at the end of how many Minaretts there were in Austria
        (Switzerland?))</li>

        <li>Analyse discourse around game in press and political

        <li>Analysis of game
        <ul>
        <li>Gameplay and mechanics
        <ul>
        <li>Mouse moves around circle that needs to be placed over
        targets. Mouse press “stops” the target, meaning, remove them
        from the screen</li>
        <li>Towers need to be removed while appearing. if not they will
        stay and the tower counter goes up, meaning you loose a
        life.</li>
        <li>The people appearing on the staying towers will not
        interefer with gameplay. “stopping” them gives points.</li>
        <li>The game ends if enough towers stay or the timer runs
        out.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Sounds
        <ul>
        <li>Muezzin who rest start to pray</li>
        <li>The towers make constructing sounds when appearing and a
        deeper dong when stay</li>
        <li>CoM
        <ul>
        <li>plays the German hymn</li>
        <li>the “stopping” uses a shooting sounds</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Moschee Baba
        <ul>
        <li>play some Ländler in the background</li>
        <li>the stopping sounds like a generic rustling click sound</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Graphics
        <ul>
        <li>The background graphics were exchanged to include landmarks
        of the respective countries
        <ul>
        <li>Which landmarks were used?</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>MA and MB use otherwise the same assets, CoM has a lot of
        the graphics exchanged (towers, people) and also the
        vectorization style</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Rhetorics
        <ul>
        <li>It’s not about discourse or conviction, but generating media
        attention and being able to repeat one’s message (classic right
        wing rhetorics)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>How was the publishing landscape in 2009 (web made sense
        because everybody can share and link)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Decided to concentrate on Minarett Attack. There is not much
        to gain from a comparison of the two games, not as far as I can
        see. The focus on racism doesn’t hold up, because one is racist,
        the other one reflects on it. But I have a hunch, that
        concentrating on the aspect of video game versus print campaign,
        as well as the games internationality. I want to try to get the
        game running as a next step. But it’s simply not possible. The
        main.swf tries to load MinaretAttach.swf (observe the spelling
        mistake). I will have to stick to what I’ll find online. I will
        make a large collection of pressmaterial, and try to sort out
        things that engage more with the game and not just the scandals
        around Moschee Baba and the FPÖ and Segert and
        alpen-donau.info.</p>
        <h2 id="minarett-attack">Minarett Attack</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>developed by Alexander Segert (Goal AG), 2010</li>
        <li>is broken and can’t be played online anymore; it’s flash
        based and i guess after the initial load, the swf tries to get
        additional assets from a server, that’s not online anymore
        (malformed language.xml, which is returning another domain’s
        html content)</li>
        <li>i did found some video material and it is very well covered
        by press, because of the people’s involvement in right-wing
        politics and some minor scandals</li>
        <li>brought developer Alexander Segert almost into prison</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <li>developed by René Bauer, Beat Suter and Mirjam Weder,
        2010</li>
        <li>still playable in different version (swf, html,
        mac/windows); extensively documented</li>
        <li>not extensively covered by press, as far as I can see at the
        moment (2023-11-22); found some blog posts</li>
        <li>there is an article co-written by René Bauer</li>
        <li>description
        <ul>
        <li>more or less classic pong. maybe slightly updated graphics.
        main changes are introduced through rules and game mechanics,
        whereas the left player is always disadvantaged</li>
