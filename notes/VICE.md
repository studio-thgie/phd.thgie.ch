# Vice
> VICE is a program that runs on a Unix, MS-DOS, Win32, OS/2, BeOS, QNX 4.x, QNX 6.x, Amiga, Syllable or Mac OS X machine and executes programs intended for the old 8-bit computers. The current version emulates the C64, the C64DTV, the C128, the VIC20, practically all PET models, the PLUS4 and the CBM-II (aka C610/C510). An extra emulator is provided for C64 expanded with the CMD SuperCPU.

At the time of writing this entry, VICE is still actively developed, starting in 1993. The V in VICE stands for versatile, meaning it is able to emulate a set of different Commodore models. The source-code of the emulator is well commented and there is a truly expansive documentation available.

The community behind the emulator is well established and visible under [Acknowledgments](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/vice_18.html). Judging from the names alone, without researching every single current and past member, the contributors seem to come mostly from Europe and the US. I believe that the research on the history of VICE could be a project on it's own. The ecosystem of information and knowledge that is accessible online is vast and feels organically grown. There are for example some hints of humor, ie the [Hall of Shame](https://vice-emu.pokefinder.org/wiki/Hall_of_Shame) (mostly the title of it) hinting to a richer social culture within the VICE developer community.

> Der erste Teil von VICE entstand 1993 als Aprilscherz. Der damalige C64-Emulator wurde von Jarko Sonninen im Fullscreen-Modus auf verschiedenen Sun-Workstations installiert. (Höltgen, 2014)
