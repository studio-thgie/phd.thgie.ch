# Game FAVR
> Arsenault, D., Côté, P.-M., & Larochelle, A. (2015). _The Game FAVR: A Framework for the Analysis of Visual Representation in Video Games_.

- Reading notes under [arsenaultGameFAVRFramework2015](literature/arsenaultGameFAVRFramework2015.md).
- Framework guidance under [https://www.ludov.ca/index.php/en/observation/graphical-technologies/game-favr](https://www.ludov.ca/index.php/en/observation/graphical-technologies/game-favr)

The paper on the topic lays out a unified framework of the [ergodic animage](notes/Ergodic%20Animage.md), the rule-based and interaction driven part of visual representation in video games. The framework is constituted by [four categories of analysis and their components](literature/arsenaultGameFAVRFramework2015.md#The%20Game%20FAVR):

- Composition
- [Ocularization](notes/Ocularization.md)
- Framing mechanism
- Plane analysis

Important is the author's explicit omission of the question of narratology versus ludology. Within Nitsche’s model of game [Spaces](notes/Spaces.md), FAVR is concerned mainly with the mediated space. It is mainly interested in the interactive parts of visuality.
