> defined by Slack and Wise as ‘dynamic interminglings that can move in many and various directions, propelled by various and changing circumstances (of other articulations). The “web” of these particular articulations is what [they] call an assemblage’” ([Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 668](zotero://select/library/items/D5S5C3ZS))
