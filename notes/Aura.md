# Aura

> “Games are much more than entertainment; they are art, they are software, but they are also inherently social. They are represented in movies and books and are the source for a plethora of derivative material, such as clothing and toys. All of which hold on to the game’s aura.” ([Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 667](zotero://select/library/items/D5S5C3ZS))

> "Like the concept of origin itself, original documents are fictions we practice in order to manage their losses and our Limits”[^1]
