        and code: Approximations of researching older digital games</h1>
        <p>The first digital games for computing systems and video
        consoles were developed as early as the 1960s. As objects of
        research, digital games embody historical perspectives and
        values, revealing how digital technology proliferated and
        organised itself. Since the 1980s, a digital game development
        culture has emerged, resulting in a global industry. Despite
        their popularity today, the early computer systems and video
        consoles that ran these games until 2000 have largely become
        obsolete. Digital games, as a specialised subset of software,
        share similar problems with their parent source category. They
        are susceptible to bit rot and media decay, which refers to “the
        gradual decay of digital information and storage media over
        time”, rendering information unreadable and digital games
        nonfunctional. This raises concerns about preservation and the
        challenges of researching digital games. </p>
        <p>Qualitative approaches driven by the social sciences and
        humanities are the primary research methods for studying digital
        games. Drawing from multiple disciplines, video game research
        often focuses on para- and intertextuality. Recently, digital
        humanities also have begun conducting inquiries into digital
        game research using methods borrowed from distant and close
        reading. Researching older video games can be a challenging task
        due to their unique nature as historical and digital artefacts.
        These games cannot be played in their original contexts, which
        were often defined by contemporary culture and hardware that is
        now outdated. While emulation can provide some insight into the
        past, it only offers a limited perspective.</p>
        <p>In this contribution, I will explore two approaches that
        attempt to address these challenges. The HGP method is a
        historical, source-critical approach to studying video games,
        which focuses on analysing production, product, and reception.
        Developed by Eugen Pfister and Arno Görgen, this method aids in
        reconstructing the original context through production- and
        reception analysis. In contrast, critical code analysis looks at
        games from the inside out, assuming that code is not only
        functional but also a social and semiotic system with its own
        grammar and meaning. It views code not only as computational
        instructions, but also as a corpus of text. While this approach
        allows for reading of context through the artefact, it suffers
        from source code being a rare good. This perspective allows for
        the application of both close critical and distant reading
        methodologies. As video games often rely on para- and
        intertextuality, these two approaches can complement each other
        where historical gaps exist. Together, they offer a more
        comprehensive understanding of digital games as historical
        artefacts. In this contribution, I will present case studies
        that showcase the unified application of these two approaches.
        The games used in this study are taken from the Confederatio
        Ludens corpus, which focuses on Swiss digital games until the
        year 2000.</p>
