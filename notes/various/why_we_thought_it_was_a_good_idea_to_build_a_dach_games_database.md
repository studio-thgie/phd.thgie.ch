# Why we thought it was a good idea to build a DACH games database

## By Eugen Pfister and Adrian Demleitner

Although digital games are still often framed in university curricula as "new media", they are no longer quite so new. Even if we only pinpoint the start of their history with their mass distribution at the end of the 1970s, we can already look back on a history of over fifty years. Their scientific research, on the other hand – Game Studies – began at the latest at the turn of the millennium. We just mention this here to show that this research discipline has now more or less successfully completed its consolidation phase – including prominent methodological debates. In this respect, it would not be presumptuous to assume that the research discipline would also have developed an awareness of the history of the object of investigation. But as soon as we take an active interest in the history of digital games, we quickly come up against a very prosaic problem: At first glance, it may seem that the status quo regarding data on historical(?) video games should be good due to the proximity of time. But in fact, the status is almost catastrophic because, for a long time, game development had no awareness of its own history at all. Not only does this mean that many important primary sources have already been lost forever, but it also means that we often lack the most basic information. This is especially true for those games that did not make it into the canon of the chronicles, which are focussing primarily on the USA and Japan. 

  

This master narrative has been reproduced uncritically for a long time. It tells the story of mostly male, white geniuses and innovators who often went against the spirit of the times to fulfillfulfil their visions: from the young MIT students who “misused” a PDP 10 computer at night to develop the game Spacewar! to the self-made millionaire and enfant terrible Nolan Bushnell, who triggered the first video game boom in the USA with the founding of Atari. Later, we read about the “great video game crash” in the USA, about hundreds of thousands of game cartridges that were shamefully buried in the desert, and about the rise of the Japanese companies Nintendo and Sega and their "console wars". This story, as we can read, for example, in Steven Kent's Ultimate History of Video Games (Kent 2001), is not fundamentally wrong - but it ignores virtually all countries outside the USA, Japan, and perhaps the UK. Europe, for example, felt little of this crash because consoles were never as widespread here as in the USA. And yet, games were played almost everywhere: at fairgrounds, in amusement arcades, and at home. While the Arcade and console market boomed in the USA and Japan, dynamic developer networks had formed in Europe around the microcomputers that were popular here: the ZX Spectrum and the Amstrad CPC, but above all, the C64, the Commodore Amiga, and MS-DOS-compatible computers. Extremely productive independent gamegames cultures developed around these platforms in Europe, but also in Australia and New Zealand.

  

The wish to research the regional and national histories arose only recently. Graeme Kirkpatrick closely examined video game culture in the United Kingdom (Kirkpatrick 2015), Alexis Blanchet and Guillaume Montagnon researched the origins of the "French touch" (Blanchet/Montagnon 2020), and Melanie Swalwell dealt extensively with the origins of homebrew culture in Australia and New Zealand (Swalwell 2021). In his study on the early history of digital games in Czechoslovakia, Jaroslav Švelch provedwas able to prove that an independent culture of digital games developed in the 1980s, even behind the Iron Curtain (Švelch 2018). These first studies on a local history of digital games have impressively shown that these histories were not marginal notes of a primarily US-Japanese dynamic, but vibrant markets and cultures in their own right.

  

The focus has changed, but we still face some practical challenges: if we search for traces of these European games from the 1980s and 1990s, a period in which game development became professionalised and commercialised, the data we havehad so far was little. For a long time, we tacitly relied on crowdsourced databases, such as MobyGames. It was temptingly convenient that we were able to draw on the invisible work of countless fans. We quickly found the developers' namesnames of developers and years of publication on the relevant sites. This data had rarely been scrutinised critically, but in the case of better-known games from the accepted canon, the data was very reliable due to the abundance of contributing fans. However, as soon as we turned to productions that had previously received little attention, often only the most basic information could be found: Names of the developer and the publisher, as well as the year of release. And even then, we quickly encountered contradictory information. The problem was that we, as video game studies researchers, have relied on the work of dedicated hobbyists and gaming enthusiasts for too long. This is not to criticise their work. Without the many unpaid hours that hobbyists have invested in recording games in online databases, we would be left with nothing today. However, the more data we have, the more we can trace a complete picture of a gaming culture with all its networks and exchange processes. The thesis of a dominant top-down US pop culture can also be questioned in this way, because it recognises the influence, but also makes the reverse influence of the local on the hegemonic sign system and its actors visible from the bottom up.

  

It is much more important for us to point out, that the problemsproblematics around the available data havehas been neglected by research for far too long. These challenges are no small matter, as we have realised from our current research project. From February 2023 to January 2027, we are investigating the “Swiss History of Games, Play, and Game Design 1968-2000” with an interdisciplinary team of 20 researchers as part of an SNSF Sinergia research project called Confoederatio Ludens. In an as holistic an approach as possible, we thus examine the emergence of an increasingly professionalised game development and gaming culture in Switzerland. Like many similar projects, we faced this problem at the outset: in principle, we knew about (some) games from the geographical area under investigation, often from our own experience. But, there are only a few and incomplete lists or databases of these games – and sometimes none. We wanted to be able to locate games geographically. However, the aim was not to construct a national genius in an essentialist interpretation, but rather to be able to recognise transnational relationships or barriers. At the same time, digital games functioned as an identity-forming appropriation of a new technology that also had a local, regional, and national impact. One focus here is on relations with German-speaking countries. To achieve this, however, we need to know more about the nationalities of the various developers, where the developer studios are located, and where the publishers are based.

  

Furthermore, a great challenge for research is that the existing data sets were collected for entirely different reasons and are, therefore, often unsuitable for scientific questions. Approximately how many games were developed in total over what period of time, and how did this number develop over time? Which systems were used, when, and where? Which genres were particularly popular? How many developers were usually involved at what times? In what form did transnational collaborations occur? How many games have been developed off the grid of classical publishing infrastructures, e.g., as lay projects or as "serious games" within institutional contexts (where, since then, in most cases, data about them has not been archived)? Regardless of whether you are interested in early homebrew culture, games used for school lessons, or the emergence of the first commercial development studios. To be able to analyse a phenomenon historically, it is necessary to have at least a rudimentary overview of the data available. This can also be seen in how frighteningly quickly things are forgotten. Even in our team, it turned out that we had all dramatically underestimated the number of early games developed in Switzerland.

For theall of these outlined reasons, we have been working with colleagues and students outside our project over the past few years to establish a dataset of digital games developed in the DACH region up to the year 2000.

## Sources, Platforms, and Frictions

As mentioned above, this DACH games dataset didn’t manifest out of thin air, but depended on an existing ecosystem of online games databases. It is helpful to roughly sketch this landscape to understand why the DACH games database was a necessary development to mitigate existing problems. We thus came across three different categories of existing  databases: general knowledge, video games in general, and topics related to video game culture.

  

General knowledge databases are online repositories that, among other things, contain information related to video games. Well-known examples are Wikipedia, Wikidata or the Internet Archive. The second relevant category of databases holds information on video games in general. Platforms like MobyGames, the Universal Videogames List, or the Online Games Datenbank try to collect as much information about as many games as possible. Especially, MobyGames was able to establish itself as an important reference and first point of contact when researching games.

  

Besides these bigger platforms exists a plethora of smaller databases that relate to video game culture and have different, specific foci. These often originated before the advent of the larger projects and grew out of niche communitiesniche-communities that are invested in preserving the knowledge of older gaming systems. To name a few, in this category, we find Hall of Light, the C64-Wiki andor Atari Mania.

  

All in all, these three categories of databases hold relevant knowledge. They are also plagued by a few specific problems, possibly complicating it to research them, making them inconclusive or unreliable. 

  

In querying the general knowledge databases, we found little to none relevant information regarding our research interests, which is the early history of video game development in the German-speaking countries. It seems that, despite holding vast amounts of information, the type of knowledge found on Wikipedia and similar places is the more established kind. Further, the granularity of information and knowledge is becoming better the more specialised the platform is. Generalizing platforms have the problem, that they need to add knowledge into a structure which might not be able to hold the specifics, in turn losing valuable information.

  

Access was another issue we had to deal with in our inquiries. All platforms offered interfaces for searching and filtering their information. The possibilities ranked from the simple text input to more complex interfaces to engage with specific metadata fields, like genre or hardware. Our own specific research interest was difficult to translate into these interfaces. Normally, it is not possible to search for the country of origin of a game. Some platforms offered search for language, but referring to the language the game is in. Some video games from Switzerland from the 1980s and 1990s were only published in the UK or France, since there was no established market at home yet. These games interest us, but they could not have been found through their in-game language, since they were missing a German translation. Database entries often hold the names of the publishers and developing studios, but hardly any address or at least a country of origin. 

  

Finally, the scientificality of these databases has to be discussed. The effort that went into the creation and maintenance of these databases is priceless, and we would have lost a good amount of knowledge on video game history without them already. Nonetheless, we should never forget that these platforms have been created out of other impulses and might not always harmonize with scientific and journalistic integrity. MobyGames, for example, uses gamification in its efforts to collect information on games. A member of the platform gains points for adding knowledge to it, sometimes more, sometimes less. Actors who worked on a game are especially valuable. The information on them is treated as a factoid, without any possibility to add any sources, e.g. where the specific information is coming from. Maybe the member adding the information copied it from the ending rolls of a game, from the back of the game box, or just from another platform. Although gamification can help in motivating people to gather information, the scientificality of this approach needs to be critically regarded.

  

The discussed platforms were indispensable for our research, despite their problems. Finally, it was helpful to develop a different understanding of them. The design of these platforms is not comparable to scientific or journalistic work, their content varying enormously in quality, standardization and scope. Rather, they can be read as communal spaces of ritual, attempting to keep game history alive, as a cultural heritage through shared practice. The only thing we needed to do, was to restructure the love and knowledge that went into these databases and make it accessible for our own research endeavour.

## How to create a dataset

When we were faced with the task to create a dataset from scratch, there were two options at hand. The scientific sensible approach would have been to set up a proper research project. The project could work on metadata-standards and a controlled vocabulary, together with funded staff and a structured search for sources. But, funding is difficult to get a hold on and results would come in late, if ever. Another option was to act more frugal and pragmatic. Start with what’s at hand, and quickly collect as much data as possible to get a first overview and clean up afterwards. In this approach, standardization and taxonomy in retrospect can be challenging as the complexity and diversity of the dataset grows with each entry.

  

Nonetheless, the DACH dataset developed through the latter option. The creation of the DACH video games dataset could not have been possible without the help of many people, forming an ad hoc small community of researchers and students. The project started out during a course, given by Eugen Pfister at the Heinrich-Heine University in Düsseldorf, in which students were “Looking for traces of early game developers in the German-speaking countries”. A second iteration on the platform was led by a smaller group of students around in which each dataset entry was cross-checked, cleaned and the sources expanded. Especially the latter task was important to distinguish the DACH dataset from already existing databases. For us, it was a prerequisite that every piece of information could be traced back to its original source.The final product of this round was a Google spreadsheet with roughly 600 entries of video games developed in the German-speaking countries.

  

The final iteration happened with the help of Lukas Daniel Klausner and the participation of the research project Confoederatio Ludens, i.e. Aurelia Brandenburg, Adriand Demleitner and Addrich Mauch and led to a first publication of a gamma version of the dataset (Pfister et al 2023). The tasks performed were roughly the same: checking the integrity of existing entries, cleaning up the dataset, adding new sources and entries. Meanwhile, new difficulties arose. Whereas before working on the dataset, it was unclear how much material we would find, it became apparent now, that we could not follow up many leads because of the sheer volume of findings. We also ran into older and more fundamental questions, for example the question of genres.

  

Since the DACH dataset was driven by a specific research question, or research interest, we were able to circumvent dealing with a few of the fundamental questions. As long as we were mainly interested in collecting evidence of the presence of these games, we didn’t have to deal intensely with the metadata specifics. Nonetheless, we did have to struggle with the challenge of ascribing nationality. More often than not are video games entangled in complex networks that challenge an easy attribution to a country. 

## Outlook

We are aware that our dataset is currently far from complete, and will also be in the foreseeable future, if not forever. So far, we have only included the listings from one magazine, for example. We even have to assume that many of the commercially distributed games are still missing, let alone homebrew games. Since we cannot estimate what percentage of the total game production we have recorded, quantitative statements beyond the corpus are at this point not statistically meaningful enough. Furthermore, categorisation into genres is still problematic (e.g. Arsenault 2009). To a certain extent, this is in the nature of things because there is still no consensus on “genres” in games research. Genre designations grew out of usage and are neither standardised nor clearly named. Some genres refer solely to game mechanics, such as FPS, others to aesthetics and narrative, such as horror. At the same time, categorisation into genres would be relevant for our research. Especially since we assume that genres played a major role in local history in the 1980s and 1990s, such as the importance of economic simulations in Germany and Austria. Similarly, the ascription of roles, such as graphic artist, developer or project manager is not that easy. Often we encounter the problem that either they held multiple roles at the same time, or there is no information on what exactly they did.

  

However, we are conscious about these often frustrating inaccuracies, and have accepted them for now – precisely because we decided not to wait for funding, but to press ahead in our spare time over a long period of developing the dataset. It was important to us to provide initial data as soon as possible – not just for our own research, but for anyone who is interested. Sometimes, even in science, it is necessary to take a "quick and dirty" approach to kick-start research. It is still astonishing to us that, until 2022, there was no relevant, easily accessible online database for game studies from the perspective of local history. And we ourselves have already benefited enormously from the work – the sample of Swiss games for the SNF Sinergia project has risen from just over 50 to over 120, thanks in part to the research of our colleagues in the project. The now existing sample of games also revealed first interesting patterns that need to be researched further. For example, it is noticeable that in the 1980s and 1990s in particular, only a few games were developed in the largest German-speaking cities, with small and medium-sized cities predominating. In the same period, the same surname is often found in many developer teams, which would suggest siblings or married couples. It is also already possible to trace the economic cycles of individual game mechanics clearly.

  

The next step would be to continue cleaning up the data, tackle the unpopular genre question, and discuss clean metadata standards in general. However, we are only at the beginning of our work. We aim to continue working on the database. At the same time, we also want as many people as possible to benefit from this preliminary work because that's all it is so far. Which is why we have already put the Gamma version online under a CC-BY-SA licence, despite all its gaps and potential errors. 

  

We are also actively endeavouring to incorporate the results into other databases, first and foremost into the Swiss Games Garden, a database concentrating on games developed in Switzerland. Also, and here for a potentially much larger audience, we are actively pushing our dataset into the Wikimedia project Wikidata. During the integration of our previous data into Wikidata, we once again faced similar challenges to those we faced when preparing the list itself. The WikiProject Video Games, a working group that deals with the entry of digital games in Wikidata, has developed its own data model and created suggestions for genres and other attributes. These do not always coincide with our list, which is why additional effort is required and consensus or compromises must be found. We are actively participating in the working group during this process and have also sought support from Jean-Frédéric Berthelot, who has been involved in this working group for a long time. According to Berthelot, Wikidata is not intended to replace all other platforms and databases, but rather to connect various game database projects with one another like the mycelium of a mushroom in a forest. Links to a game's entries in other databases are therefore of great importance.

  

It is a great pleasure to see how many people responded to our database in the first few weeks after publication. In some cases, we received individual additions, in others, entire lists with several hundred titles that now need to be incorporated. Above all, however, we are delighted to see how many colleagues have been inspired by our work - and will hopefully make the data even better in the future.
