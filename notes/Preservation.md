## [Assembling Auras](literature/guay-belangerAssemblingAurasMethodology2022.md)

In this paper the author Dany Guay-Bélanger attempts to redefine what makes up a game, showing that we need to understand them much more as fluid assemblages that hold auras of "the original". The final question then being:

> “what are game historians and preservationists aiming for, accuracy or authenticity?” ([Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 671](zotero://select/library/items/D5S5C3ZS))

According to Dany Guay-Bélanger, notions of assemblage, intertextuality, paratextuality, and the concept of the aura can help for video game preservation emphasising authenticity (Guay-Bélanger, 2022). He argues against the possibilities to be accurat, and focusing on being authentic instead.

> “In essence, being accurate refers to an attempt to reproduce the original as closely as possible, while being authentic suggests that the meaning of the original is put forward.” ([Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 671](zotero://select/library/items/D5S5C3ZS))

> “there needs to be an approach to video game preservation emphasising authenticity, meaning it acknowledges the presentness of a game and that some aspects of games cannot be saved unless compromises are made and scholars of video game preservation consider diverse materials and alternative tactics.” ([Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 672](zotero://select/library/items/D5S5C3ZS))
