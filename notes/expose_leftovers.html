        <li>Coding for digital graphics involves a multimodal design
        approach. The code written, and the output generated by that
        code does not correlate aesthetically. The brief moment of
        translation, from one system of signifiers into another, happens
        already in the programmer or designer before the computational
        act itself. There is a double rhetoric at play, one for the
        code, one for the visuality, as well as an abstraction from a
        desired output into machinic language.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
        <p>To what extent are the technological foundations of video
        games and their visuality entangled? Can they be treated as
        separate domains, or do they have to be read as paratexts to
        each other? Are they on a semiological continuum, or is there a
        shift of expression at the moment of transformation from code to
        image? Can a games code be read meaningful towards the image
        that it emanates?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>How do game developers use programming to create the visual
        design of digital games, and what are the implications of this
        approach for the relationship between technology and aesthetics
        in game design?</li>
        <li>How does the interplay between the technological limits of
        digital game development and the reception of the image
        influence the generation of meaning for players, and what are
        the implications of this interplay for game design?</li>
        <li>In what ways do game designers and developers encode meaning
        and rhetoric into the images of digital games, and how do these
        choices affect players’ emotions and perceptions?</li>
        <li>How has the concept of “visuality” in digital games evolved,
        and what are the specific characteristics that differentiate it
        from other forms of visual media?</li>
        <li>What role does ergodicity play in shaping the visuality of
        digital games, and how does it affect players’ engagement with
        the game’s images and narratives?</li>
        <li>How has the technological evolution of digital game
        development tools and hardware influenced the visual design and
        material aspects of digital games, and how have these changes
        impacted the semiotics of game imagery?</li>
        <li>What are the techno-historic limits that early digital game
        design faced, and how did these limits shape the formal and
        semiotic aspects of the visuality of early digital games?</li>
        <li>How can critical code analysis be applied to better
        understand the relationship between the technological foundation
        of digital games and the visible image, and what insights can
        this approach provide into the development of game visuals?</li>

        <h5 id="work-package-0--2023-2024">Work Package 0 –
        2023-2024</h5>
        <p>WP0 is reserved for getting a good overview, setting the
        focus, working on the expose, attaining the necessary ECTS
        points needed for the PhD. Part of working on the expose are
        case studies to inquire focus-related and methodological
        questions. The case studies are listed under 2.3.</p>
        <h5 id="work-package-1--1-half-2024">Work Package 1 – 1. half
        2024</h5>
        <p>WP1 concentrates on the discipline of digital humanities as
        well as the building, maintaining, and analysing of an image
        corpus regarding the visuality of digital games. The corpus was
        a case study that is outlined in 2.3.1.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Questions: What kind of knowledge can an image corpus on
        digital games generate? What kind of knowledge is lost in the
        process (see ergodicity)? What are the infrastructural
        necessities to enable distant and close readings of the image
        corpus?</li>
        <li>Methods: Image corpus analysis</li>
        <li>Publishing medium: Digital humanities journal, TBD</li>
        <li>Schedule
        <ul>
        <li>1 - 2 months: Building corpus</li>
        <li>3 - 4 months: Analysing through distant and close reading
        methods</li>
        <li>1 - 2 months: Write-up findings, publish and rewrite</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Part of this work package is the start of a digital edition,
        that enables the exploration of the image corpus, as well as
        other data relevant to my dissertation. This edition could stand
        on its own, or be structured to fit a specific publication.</p>
        <h5 id="work-package-2--2-half-2024">Work Package 2 – 2. half
        2024</h5>
        <p>WP2 shifts to the HGP-method as well as design rhetoric, see
        4.3.3. I will define three case studies in which I will analyse
        the visuality of one digital game, or a group of games, within
        their historical contexts. The goal is to identify flows and
        novelties, pop-cultural references and visual discourse
        regarding the visuality and how those relate to Switzerland as a
        historic unity.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Questions: What is the specific visuality of digital games
        made in Switzerland? What kind of influences did it take up,
        propagate, and what kind of elements did it add to the
        discourse?</li>
        <li>Methods: Design rhetoric, HGP-method</li>
        <li>Publishing medium: Video game studies journal, Design
        rhetoric journal, TBD</li>
        <li>Schedule
        <ul>
        <li>1 month: Defining case studies</li>
        <li>3 - 4 months: One month per case study, analysing the
        digital game(s) through the mentioned method and the images
        collected in WP1</li>
        <li>1 - 2 months: Write-up findings, publish and rewrite</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="work-package-3--1-half-2025">Work Package 3 – 1. half
        2025</h5>
        <p>WP3 focuses on a corpus which will take time to create, that
        is, the archive holding the source code of the games. The
        collection of, or search for, digital games source code will
        start as early as possible. In most cases, this material will be
        found through the original developers, if the source code has
        been preserved at all. Alternative ways to obtain source code
        will be considered as well. For example, decompressing the games
        when they were written in Basic, which does not compile. The
        source code archive will be worked through digital humanities
        distant reading approaches, such as corpus analysis, as well as
        close reading attempts and critical code analysis.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Questions: How can we work academically with digital games’
        source code? How does source code behave as corpus and archival
        material? What kind of text is source code, and how can digital
        humanities distant reading approach handle it?</li>
        <li>Methods: Critical code analysis</li>
        <li>Publishing medium: Digital humanities journal, TBD</li>
        <li>Schedule:
        <ul>
        <li>2 months: Building of source code archive</li>
        <li>2 - 3 months: Distant and close reading analysis of source
        code</li>

        </ul>
        <h5 id="work-package-4--2-half-2025">Work Package 4 – 2. half
        2025</h5>
        <p>WP4 combines work done in the previous work packages and
        attempts to unify several methodological approaches (distant
        reading, close reading, design rhetoric, critical code
        analysis). The aim of this work package is to inquire the
        original hypothesis and questions regarding the invisible rift
        between the research on the image of the digital game and its
        material base, as well as my assumption that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        digital game development and the reception of the image. I will
        define three case studies of digital games of which I have
        material in my image corpus and source code archive, and apply
        said method in combination to methodological results from former
        work packages. To this end, findings from WP2 and WP3 will be
        combined and extended.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Questions: To what extent are the technological foundations
        of video games and their visuality entangled? Can they be
        treated as separate domains, or do they have to be read as
        paratexts to each other? Are they on a semiological continuum,
        or is there a shift of expression at the moment of
        transformation from code to image? Can a games code be read
        meaningful towards the image that it emanates?</li>
