# Layers
The evolution of technology is always present in the layers that make modern computing. The layers translate between the alien logic of computing hardware and human expression.

The path one takes through the layers does something to the designer[^1], the designing[^2], and the designed[^3]. These layers and their parts constitute knowledge and work that is always to some extent implicit, and doesn't have to be known or understood by the designer. These layers are also the equivalent to different ways of designing, according to one [Goût](notes/Goût.md) and type of designer (amateur, professional, visual, logic, etc.).
