        <h2 id="introduction-and-problem-statement">1. Introduction and
        problem statement</h2>
        <p>Video games are manifestations of designerly intentions,
        which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into an
        output. People of all trades, from code to graphics, thus
        transform their knowledge and skills into a playable and
        meaningful experience. But as cultural products, video games
        communicate much more than these intentioned designs. They also
        capture unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and
        ideologies, as well as historical contexts.</p>
        <p>This is equally true for the visuality of the video game, on
        which this proposal is concentrating. To analyse this, I will
        present an approach of critical reading of the transformation of
        code to images (rewrite this part after <a
        href="literature/fizekLudicGlassMaking2022.html">Sonia Fizek’s
        text</a>). Drawing on critical code analysis and design
        rethorics, I combine methodologies from design research and the
        digital humanities. Critical readings serve the purpose of
        unearthing and dissecting power structures and the generation of
        meaning in and from our cultural artefacts. Such readings open
        up our research objects to a plethora of interpretations.</p>
        <p>The images in video games differ from paintings or
        photographs. They are not materially fixed in time-space, but
        again and again computed, reacting on interaction and changes in
        the game state. If we take a closer look at the image of video
        games and accept it as an artefact that is calculated and
        constructed by code and computer hardware, we must conclude that
        the underlying technology is formative for its discourse and
        meaning. Respectively, that programmers and graphic designers
        alike are significantly involved in the circulation and
        formation of meanings and power relations through the image in
        video games.</p>
        <p>In my approach assume a hitherto invisible rift between the
        research on the image of the digital game and its material base.
        The image of digital games brings with its own specificities.
        The constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from
        the hardware’s calculation. It is interactive and as such holds
        within itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing
        itself upon the player’s input. Research on the image of digital
        games more often than not focuses either on the constituted and
        visible image, or its material basis – either on visuality or
        technology.</p>
        <p>Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        digital game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent
        from digital humanities, design research and video game studies
        and assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical
        reading the visuality of digital games.</p>
        <h3 id="visuality">1.1 Visuality</h3>
        <p>In using the term visuality I depend on the definitions
        brought forward by Gillian Rose. Here, visuality refers to the
        socio-cultural construction of how and what we see (Rose, 2016).
        I’m building on these descriptions as I am mainly interested in
        the image as a medium of communication, a semiotic device that
        attempts to transport meaning, and using rhetorics to transform
        intentions into affects. Coming from design rhetorics, I am
        interested in how designers and developers of games encoded
        meaning and rhetoric into the images, as well as the effects of
        these onto the players. Gillian Rose herself is building upon
        the work by Hal Foster, who defined visuality as the “how we
        see, how we are able, allowed, or made to see, and how we see
        this seeing and the unseeing therein”. This relates the term
        visuality to the slightly more complex scopic regime (Jay,
        2008).</p>
        <h3 id="historical-visuality-in-digital-games">1.2 (Historical)
        Visuality in digital games</h3>
        <p>As in every other medium, the visuality in digital games has
        its own specifics. Being of high relevancy to this dissertation,
        I’ll try to outline two of them in the following: ergodicity and
        techno-historic limits.</p>
        <p>Digital games are especially demanding of their consumers as
        the medium relies on a high level of participation. The
        difference between reading a book, watching a film or playing a
        digital game was especially well captured by Espen Aarseth’s
        application of ergodicity in his book Cybertext. Coming from
        literature studies, Aarseth speaks of a “nontrivial effort
        [that] is required to allow the reader to traverse the text”
        (Aarseth, 1997). This needed effort does not guarantee an
        exhaustive capture of the played game or a successful
        play-through. The player creates a path through the
        configuration of a textual machine, by participating in the
        game.</p>
        <p>This ergodicity is an important aspect when considering the
        image visible on the screen. The image represents one possible
        state, defined by the elements that the designers of the game
        provided, configured by the player’s participation. At the same
        moment, the image on screen communicates choices for the player,
        who then can reconfigure it by acting within the game. The image
        holds its own future possibilities by being within a feedback
        loop between itself and the player. The above outlined process
        happens in parallel to the communicative features of the image,
        which can also speak of information relevant to the game’s
        state, such as highscores or player lives, as well as
        transporting narratives that are creating context and experience
        for the player.</p>
        <p>The second aspect of heightened relevance is the relationship
        between the image and its technological structures, from which
        it springs forth. Being digital born, the image in digital games
        is depending on hardware and software in order to be seen. These
        can be considered the material aspect of visuality in digital
        games. Analog to Aarseth’s coining of cybertext, Stefan Möring
        applies the term cyberimage to denote the images dependance on
        its underlying technological structures as well as the player’s
        interaction with the machine (Gerling et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>Todays digital games playing devices are powerful computers
        and myriad of softwares and frameworks aid in the development
        and design. Game design in the early days of game development
        looked quite different. The capabilities of computers were
        fairly limited and the technical realisation of the games had to
        be done in early programming languages, such as Basic or
        Assembler dialects. This circumstances form the techno-historic
        limits of early digital game design and directly influenced
        formal and semiotic aspects of those games’ visuality
        (Hutchison, 2008). These limits as well as the intimate
        interplay between the technological foundation as a semiotic
        system in itself and the visible image will be considered in
        this dissertation through the application of critical code
        analysis (Marino, 2020).</p>

        visuality in digital games, and its materiality</h4>
        <p>Based on my assumptions, it is my hypothesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        video game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole.</p>
        <p>Coding for visuality involves multimodal design. The code
        written and the output generated by that code does not correlate
        aesthetically. The brief moment of translation, from one system
        of signifiers into another happens already in the coders mind
        (or knowledge) before the computational act itself. There is a
        double rhetoric at play, one for the code, one for the
        visuality.</p>
        <p>I am essentially interested in the transformation or
        translation of meaning from one system of signifiers into
        another. The materiality of visuality in video games is only on
        the surface comparable to paint in the painting. It is much
        closer to artworks where the artist wrote instructions. The
        basis of the image in video games is of textual nature, and as
        such opens it self to being analysed like a literal text.</p>

        <p>This dissertation has the following interlocking research
        objectives.</p>
        <h4
        id="historical-design-analysis-of-the-visuality-of-swiss-video-games-todo">4.1.1
        Historical design analysis of the visuality of Swiss video games
        #todo</h4>
        <p>This objective connects the dissertation to the research
        project Confederatio Ludens and its research goal of analysing
        the history of Swiss video game design and development. The
        focus is laid on the analysis of the image material. The goal is
        to identify flows and novelties, popcultural references and
        visual discourse regarding the visuality and how those relate to
        Switzerland as a historic unity.</p>
        <p>Part of this research objective is the creation of three
        corpora. The first consists of the digital games that are
        researched in the Confoederatio Ludens project. The project will
        maintain it’s own dataset, hosted on the Swiss Games Garden
        platform, which consists of a Drupal installation and a custom
        frontend. In order to uphold FAIR/CARE principles, I will
        maintain a duplicate dataset on Wikidata. Being linked-data and
        graph-based, Wikidata will enable some machine-assisted research
        approaches, such as visualising networks of actors.</p>
        <p>The second corpus consists of visual material regarding the
        digital games from the games list. The images will mainly be
        taken directly from the games according to a predefined
        strategy, as well as collected from online archives. Since the
        focus of the dissertation is on the interplay of code and image,
        paratextual material such as box arts or advertisement will only
        be collected for case studies. The collection strategy includes
        formal elements, game content and is further build on the Game
        FAVR (Arsenault et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>The last corpus will consist of source code of the digital
        games in our corpus, where such can be acquired.</p>
        <p>More information on the corpora can be found under 5.2.2.</p>
        <h4
        id="bridging-the-analysis-of-visuality-and-technology-in-video-games-todo">4.1.2
        Bridging the analysis of visuality and technology in video games
        #todo</h4>
        <p>Stepping fully into my own dissertation I want to bridge the
        analysis of two different domains. Code and visuality are
        interrelated and part of the feedback loop of gaming machine and
        player. This objective is distinguished by being research
        through a methodological approach, the goal being testing and
        examining the possibilities of a joined analysis of the two
        halves of this proposed whole.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>this needs to be expanded</li>
        </ul>
        <h4
        id="discourse-on-multimodality-of-coding-for-visuality-todo">4.1.3
        Discourse on multimodality of coding for visuality #todo</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>this needs rewritting: focus on the designerly act</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The third objective wants to research the consequences,
        impact and effects of momentum of transformation from code to
        visuality. If code and image are interrelated in terms of
        meaning and discourse, video game developers working on
        technical aspects have to be inquired in terms of their power to
        shape the image discourse. Think of how pixels and glitches
        entered our aesthetic vocabulary. This object is gearing towards
        a media-theoretical approach that expands Vilém Flussers concept
        of the <em>technical image</em> towards video games.</p>
        <p>It is hardly possible to see beyond the horizon of
        transformation from code to image. Looking at the visuality one
        can only make assumption about the code and vice versa. This has
        a profound impact on designing visuality through code.</p>
        <h3 id="research-questions">4.2 Research questions</h3>
        <p>To what extend are the technological foundations of video
        games and their visuality entangled? Can they be treated as
        separate domains, or do they have to be read as paratexts to
        each other? Are they on a semiological continuum, or is there a
        shift of expression at the moment of transformation from code to
        image? Can a games code be read meaningful towards the image
        that it emanates?</p>
        <h2 id="research-design-and-methodology">5. Research design and
        methodology</h2>
        <h3 id="research-data">5.1 Research data</h3>
        <p>The research base material is built by two corpora – the
        digital games list and it’s metadata, and visual material
        regarding those games. Whereas I am actively working
        collaboratively with the research team on the former, I am
        solely responsible for the latter. From the base material games
        list corpus I will choose a reasonable number of exemplary as
        well as exceptional games. Exemplary means that some of the
        games stand in for popular genres of the time, while some others
        can’t be put in such a schema. Further information on the
        corpora is outline in 5.2.2.</p>
        <h3 id="methodology">5.2 Methodology</h3>
        <p>The following outlines the methods I will apply.</p>
        <h4 id="literature-review">5.2.1 Literature Review</h4>
        <p>Relevant literature has been covered in point 2.1. The
        literature review was key to identify the research gap outlined
        in point 2.2. Further literature review will be conducted
        towards visuality in video games from a media theoretical
        perspective as well as the notion of text regarding program
        code.</p>
        <h4 id="corpora-building-and-analysis">5.2.2 Corpora building
        and analysis</h4>
        <p>In this dissertation project, I will help building and
        maintaining three different corpora.</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>A comprehensive list of Swiss digital games until the year
        2000 and their accompanying metadata, such as factual
        information, computing systems, genre, and actors involved in
        the development and distribution</li>
        <li>A catalog of images containing visual material for the games
        in the first corpus</li>
        <li>An archive of source code from the games in the first
        corpus</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I reported on the current state of the first corpus in 2.3.1.
        This is partially a collaborative endeavour. In contrast, the
        image corpus is my sole responsibility. It is built following a
        strategy to include as much material as is necessary to fully
        represent a games’ aesthetics and content. Next to formal
        elements, a list of the visual content of a game the Game FAVR
        (see 2.1) model of categorisation of the visuality of a digital
        game can help to obtain the right material.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Formal Elements: Color schemes, typography,
        compositions</li>
        <li>Content: Levels, sprites and characters</li>

        construction of tangible space</li>

        </ul>
        <p>As my dissertation is relying on the critical reading of
        source code I will have to acquire this specific research
        material into it’s own archive. If such an acquisition is
        possible is defined at the time of writing this exposé. Being
        able to research the interplay of technology and visuality in
        our Swiss digital games corpus would be the best possible
        outcome. Further thoughts on this problematic can be found in
        5.3.1.</p>
        <p>All three corpora are built and maintained with FAIR/CARE
        principles in mind. The metadata in the corpus on Swiss digital
        games will be regularly published as linked open data on
        Wikidata. The catalog of images will be worked on in Tropy and
        disseminated in an Omeka archive, as well as on Zenodo. The
        archive of source code has no clear long-term path yet, but
        efforts are being made to create sustainable digital games
        archives in Switzerland. Cooperation with these archives is
        desirable.</p>
        <h4 id="horror-game-politics-method">5.2.3 Horror Game Politics
        Method</h4>
        <p>The HGP method is a historical, source-critical approach to
        studying video games, which focuses on analysing production,
        product, and reception. Developed by Eugen Pfister and Arno
        Görgen, this method aids in reconstructing the original context
        through production- and reception analysis.</p>
        <p>Since I will study the visuality as well as the source code
        of digital games mainly from the 1980ies and 1990ies it is
        important to situate the analysis properly in its historical
        context. The HGP method is building on Roland Barthes approach
        to myth-making, and was applied to reading into the political
        myth of horror games. This aspect of the HGP method will help me
        in the discourse analysis of case studies, outlined in
        5.2.6.</p>
        <h4 id="design-rhetoric-todo">5.2.5 Design rhetoric #todo</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>I feel that design rhetorics is a key methods in bringing
        technology and visuality together. There is a beautiful tension
        between the intentions of the developers and graphic artists,
        that are deposited into the source code, and the affects created
        in the image on screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="critical-code-analysis-1">5.2.6 Critical code
        analysis</h4>
        <p>Critical code analysis describes source code for software not
        only as functional instructions for machines, but also as
        cultural artefacts written by humans for humans, akin
        literature. This means, that source code could potentially be
        read in order to acquire knowledge about socio-cultural and
        historical contexts. To what extend source code can be treated
        as a literary text, or leaning more on the Foucauldian notion of
        text, has been tested and described in 2.4.3. First preliminary
        results indicate that source code is rich in knowledge, but
        difficult to access through digital humanities distant readings
        approaches.</p>
        <h3 id="possible-problems">5.3 Possible problems</h3>
        <p>In the following I will reflect on possible weaknesses in
        outlined research design as well as how to mitigate the
        risks.</p>
        <h4 id="critical-code-analysis-2">5.3.1 Critical code
        analysis</h4>
        <p>Although researching context is key to this methodology, it’s
        main focus is source code. In the case of old digital games,
        such source code can be hard to obtain. Problems can arise for
        example if the original developers can’t be contacted, don’t
        want to share their code base or don’t have it anymore. It is
        certain that some source code can be found, although maybe not
        of the originally targeted games. As a fallback, games from
        beyond the scope of the corpus could be enlarged to find
        material for this approach.</p>
        <p>It is one of this dissertations appeals to open data: In
        order to study digital games, we need not only their compiled
        version, but also their raw source material, their game
        code.</p>
        <h4 id="image-reception">5.3.2 Image reception</h4>
        <p>As a historical analysis, research into the reception of the
        image, an important aspect of design rhetoric, is limited. This
        shortcoming can be balanced by the Horror-Game-Politics method,
        which is a source-critical approach that builds on research into
        the context.</p>
