        <h3 id="visuality">1.1 Visuality</h3>
        <p>In using the term visuality I depend on the definitions
        brought forward by Gillian Rose and Paolo Favero. Here,
        visuality refers to the socio-cultural construction of how and
        what we see (Rose, 2016). I’m building on these descriptions as
        I am mainly interested in the image as a medium of
        communication, a semiotic device that attempts to transport
        meaning, and using rhetorics to transform intentions into
        affects. Coming from design rhetorics, I am interested in how
        designers and developers of games encoded meaning and rhetoric
        into the images, as well as the effects of these onto the
        players. Gillian Rose herself is building upon the work by Hal
        Foster, who defined visuality as the “how we see, how we are
        able, allowed, or made to see, and how we see this seeing and
        the unseeing therein”. This relates the term visuality to the
        slightly more complex scopic regime (Jay, 2008).</p>
        <h3 id="historical-visuality-in-digital-games">1.2 (Historical)
        Visuality in digital games</h3>
        <p>As in every other medium, the visuality in digital games has
        its own specifics. Being of high relevancy to this dissertation,
        I’ll try to outline two of them in the following: ergodicity and
        techno-historic limits.</p>
        <p>Digital games are especially demanding of their consumers as
        the medium relies on a high level of participation. The
        difference between reading a book, watching a film or playing a
        digital game was especially well captured by Espen Aarseth’s
        application of ergodicity in his book Cybertext. Coming from
        literature studies, Aarseth speaks of a “nontrivial effort
        [that] is required to allow the reader to traverse the text”
        (Aarseth, 1997). This needed effort does not guarantee an
        exhaustive capture of the played game or a successful
        play-through. The player creates a path through the
        configuration of a textual machine, by participating in the
        game.</p>
        <p>This ergodicity is an important aspect when considering the
        image visible on the screen. The image represents one possible
        state, defined by the elements that the designers of the game
        provided, configured by the player’s participation. At the same
        moment, the image on screen communicates choices for the player,
        who then can reconfigure it by acting within the game. The image
        holds its own future possibilities by being within a feedback
        loop between itself and the player. The above outlined process
        happens in parallel to the communicative features of the image,
        which can also speak of information relevant to the game’s
        state, such as highscores or player lives, as well as
        transporting narratives that are creating context and experience
        for the player.</p>
        <p>The second aspect of heightened relevance is the relationship
        between the image and its technological structures, from which
        it springs forth. Being digital born, the image in digital games
        is depending on hardware and software in order to be seen. These
        can be considered the material aspect of visuality in digital
        games. Analog to Aarseth’s coining of cybertext, Stefan Möring
        applies the term cyberimage to denote the images dependance on
        its underlying technological structures as well as the player’s
        interaction with the machine (Gerling et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>Todays digital games playing devices are powerful computers
        and myriad of softwares and frameworks aid in the development
        and design. Game development in the early days of game design
        looked quite different. The capabilities of computers were
        fairly limited and the technical realisation of the games had to
        be done in early programming languages, such as Basic or even
        Assembler dialects. This circumstances form the techno-historic
        limits of early digital game design and directly influenced
        formal and semiotic aspects of those games’ visuality
        (Hutchison, 2008). These limits as well as the intimate
        interplay between the technological foundation as a semiotic
        system in itself and the visible image will be considered in
        this dissertation through the application of critical code
        analysis (Marino, 2020).</p>

        <h4 id="the-image-in-digital-games-and-its-materiality">2.2.2
        The image in digital games and its materiality</h4>
        <p>Based on my assumptions, it is my hypothesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        video game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole.</p>
        <p>Coding for visuality involves multimodal design. The code
        written and the output generated by that code does not correlate
        aesthetically. The brief moment of translation, from one system
        of signifiers into another happens already in the coders mind
        (or knowledge) before the computational act itself. There is a
        double rhetoric at play, one for the code, one for the
        visuality.</p>
        <p>I am essentially interested in the transformation or
        translation of meaning from one system of signifiers into
        another. The materiality of visuality in video games is only on
        the surface comparable to paint in the painting. It is much
        closer to artworks where the artist wrote instructions. The
        basis of the image in video games is of textual nature, and as
        such opens it self to being analysed like a literal text.</p>

        <h3 id="objectives">4.1 Objectives</h3>
        <p>This dissertation has the following interlocking research
        objectives.</p>
        <h4 id="historical-design-analysis-of-swiss-video-games">4.1.1
        Historical design analysis of Swiss video games</h4>
        <p>This objective connects the dissertation with the research
        project Confederatio Ludens and its research goal of analysing
        the history of Swiss video game design and development. The
        focus is laid on the discourse analysis of the image material.
        The goal is to identify flows and novelties, popcultural
        references and visual discourse regarding the visuality and how
        those relate to the concept of Switzerland as a historic
        unity.</p>
        <p>Part of this research objective is the creation of two
        corpora. The first consists of the digital games that are
        researched in the Confoederatio Ludens project. The project will
        maintain it’s own dataset, hosted on the Swiss Games Garden
        platform, which consists of a Drupal installation and a custom
        frontend. In order to uphold FAIR/CARE principles, I will
        maintain a duplicate dataset on Wikidata. Being linked-data and
        graph-based, Wikidata will enable some machine-assisted research
        approaches, such as visualising networks of actors.</p>
        <p>The second corpus consists of visual material regarding the
        digital games from the games list. The images will mainly be
        taken directly from the games according to a strategy laid out
        later. Since the focus of the dissertation is on the interplay
        of code and image, paratextual material such as box arts or
        advertisement will only be collected for case studies. The
        collection strategy includes formal elements, game content and
        is further build on the Game FAVR (Arsenault et al., 2015).</p>
        <h4
        id="bridging-the-analysis-of-visuality-and-technology-in-video-games">4.1.2
        Bridging the analysis of visuality and technology in video
        games</h4>
        <p>Stepping fully into my own dissertation I want to bridge the
        analysis of two different domains. Code and visuality are
        interrelated and part of the feedback loop of gaming machine and
        player. This objective is distinguished by being research on a
        methodological approach, the goal being testing and examining
        the possibilities of a joined analysis of the two halves of this
        proposed whole.</p>
        <h4
        id="discourse-on-multimodality-of-coding-for-visuality">4.1.3
        Discourse on multimodality of coding for visuality</h4>
        <p>The third objective wants to research the consequences,
        impact and effects of momentum of transformation from code to
        visuality. If code and image are interrelated in terms of
        meaning and discourse, video game developers working on
        technical aspects have to be inquired in terms of their power to
        shape the image discourse. Think of how pixels and glitches
        entered our aesthetic vocabulary. This object is gearing towards
        a media-theoretical approach that expands Vilém Flussers concept
        of the <em>technical image</em> towards video games.</p>
        <p>It is hardly possible to see beyond the horizon of
        transformation from code to image. Looking at the visuality one
        can only make assumption about the code and vice versa. This has
        a profound impact on designing visuality through code.</p>
        <h3 id="research-questions">4.2 Research questions</h3>
        <p>To what extend was nationality approached through the
        visuality of digital games made in Switzerland in 20th century?
        How does the visuality of digital games work with the concept of
        nationality?</p>
        <h4 id="related-questions">Related Questions</h4>
        <p>To what extend are the technological foundations of video
        games and their visuality entangled? Can they be treated as
        separate domains, or do they have to be read as paratexts to
        each other? Are they on a semiological continuum, or is there a
        shift of expression at the moment of transformation from code to
        image? Can a games code be read meaningful towards the image
        that it emanates?</p>
        <h2 id="research-design-and-methodology">5. Research design and
        methodology</h2>
        <h3 id="research-data">5.1 Research data</h3>
        <p>The research base material is built by two corpora – the
        digital games list and it’s metadata, and visual material
        regarding those games. Whereas I am actively working
        collaboratively with the research team on the former, I am
        solely responsible for the latter. From this base material I
        will choose a reasonable number of exemplary games, which could
        be around 20 starting from experiences in similar projects.
        Exemplary means that some of the games stand in for popular
        genres of the time, while some others can’t be put in such a
        schema. Further information on the corpora is outline in
        5.2.2.</p>
        <h3 id="methodology">5.2 Methodology</h3>
        <p>The following points will outline the methods I will apply
        during my dissertation project.</p>
        <h4 id="literature-review">5.2.1 Literature Review</h4>
        <p>Worked on literature has been covered in point 2.1. The
        literature review was key to identify the research gap outlined
        in point 2.3. Further literature review will be conducted
        towards visuality in video games from a media theoretical
        perspective as well as the notion of text regarding program
        code.</p>
        <h4 id="corpora-building-and-analysis">5.2.2 Corpora building
        and analysis</h4>
        <p>In this dissertation project, I will help building and
        maintaining three different corpora.</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>A comprehensive list of Swiss digital games until the year
        2000 and their accompanying metadata, such as factual
        information, computing systems, genre, and actors involved in
        the development and distribution</li>
        <li>A catalog of images containing visual material for the games
        in the first corpus</li>
        <li>An archive of source code from the games in the first
        corpus</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I reported on the current state of the first corpus in 2.3.1.
        This is partially a collaborative endeavour. In contrast, the
        image corpus is my sole responsibility. It is built following a
        strategy to include as much material as is necessary to fully
        represent a games’ aesthetics and content. Next to formal
        elements, a list of the visual content of a game the Game FAVR
        (see 2.1) model of categorisation of the visuality of a digital
        game can help to obtain the right material.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Formal Elements: Color schemes, typography,
        compositions</li>
        <li>Content: Levels, sprites and characters</li>
        <li>FAVR: Visual modes, ocularizations, framing mechanisms,
        construction of tangible space</li>
        <li>Relevant paratexts: Box art, manuals, advertisement,
        etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As my dissertation is relying on the critical reading of
        source code I will have to acquire this specific research
        material into it’s own archive. If such an acquisition is
        possible is unsure at the time of writing this exposé. Being
        able to research the interplay of technology and visuality in
        our Swiss digital games corpus would be the best possible
        outcome. Further thoughts on this problematic can be found in
        5.3.1.</p>
        <p>All three corpora are built and maintained with FAIR/CARE
        principles in mind. The metadata in the corpus on Swiss digital
        games will be regularly published as linked open data on
        Wikidata. The catalog of images will be worked on in Tropy and
        disseminated in an Omeka archive. The archive of source code has
        no clear long-term path yet, but efforts are being made to
        create sustainable digital games archives in Switzerland.
        Cooperation with these archives is desirable.</p>
        <h4 id="horror-game-politics-method">5.2.3 Horror Game Politics
        Method</h4>
        <p>The HGP method is a historical, source-critical approach to
        studying video games, which focuses on analysing production,
        product, and reception. Developed by Eugen Pfister and Arno
        Görgen, this method aids in reconstructing the original context
        through production- and reception analysis.</p>
        <p>Since I will study the visuality as well as the source code
        of digital games mainly from the 1980ies and 1990ies it is
        important to situate the analysis properly in its historical
        context. The HGP method is building on Roland Barthes approach
        to myth-making, and was applied to reading into the political
        myth of horror games. This aspect of the HGP method will help me
        in the discourse analysis of case studies, outlined in
        5.2.7.</p>
        <h4 id="oral-history">5.2.4 Oral History</h4>
        <p>An important aspect of the Confoederatio Ludens project is
        filling in the archival gap on the development of digital games
        in Switzerland. Researching the intentions of the developers,
        coders and graphic artists is linked to this dissertation’s
        methods design rhetoric as well as critical code analysis,
        outlined in 5.2.5 and 5.2.6. I will approach oral history from
        an anthropological perspective, attempting to research the
        cultural context from the perspectives of the people entangled
        within those contexts. A goal of this method is to find and
        identify the migration, translation and transformation of visual
        signifiers that are visible in the games as well as
        understanding where the knowledge and skills regarding
        programming are coming from.</p>
        <h4 id="design-rhetoric-todo">5.2.5 Design rhetoric #todo</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>I feel that design rhetorics is a key methods in bringing
        technology and visuality together. There is a beautiful tension
        between the intentions of the developers and graphic artists,
        that are deposited into the source code, and the affects created
        in the image on screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="critical-code-analysis-1">5.2.6 Critical code
        analysis</h4>
        <p>Critical code analysis describes source code for software not
        only as functional instructions for machines, but also as
        cultural artefacts written by humans for humans, akin
        literature. This means, that source code could potentially be
        read in order to acquire knowledge about socio-cultural and
        historical contexts. To what extend source code can be treated
        as a literary text, or leaning more on the Foucauldian notion of
        text, has been tested and described in 2.4.3. First preliminary
        results indicate that source code is rich in knowledge, but
        difficult to access through digital humanities distant readings
        approaches.</p>

        <h3 id="possible-problems">5.3 Possible problems</h3>
        <p>In the following I will reflect on possible weaknesses in
        outlined research design as well as how to mitigate the
        risks.</p>
        <h4 id="critical-code-analysis-2">5.3.1 Critical code
        analysis</h4>
        <p>Although researching context is key to this methodology, it’s
        main focus is source code. In the case of old digital games,
        such source code can be hard to obtain. Problems can arise for
        example if the original developers can’t be contacted, don’t
        want to share their code base or don’t have it anymore. It is
        certain that some source code can be found, although maybe not
        of the originally targeted games. As a fallback, games from
        beyond the scope of the corpus could be enlarged to find
        material for this approach.</p>
        <p>It is one of this dissertations appeals to open data: In
        order to study digital games, we need not only their compiled
        version, but also their raw source material, their game
        code.</p>
        <h4 id="image-reception">5.3.2 Image reception</h4>
        <p>As a historical analysis, research into the reception of the
        image, an important aspect of design rhetoric, is limited. This
        shortcoming can be balanced by the Horror-Game-Politics method,
        which is a source-critical approach that builds on research into
        the context.</p>
