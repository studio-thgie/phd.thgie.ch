        <li>Intro
        <ul>
        <li>Emulators are crucial to the research of old video games
        but, beyond describing their functionality, only few attempts
        were made to research them</li>
        <li><a
        href="output/game_science/game_science_abstract.html">abstract</a></li>
        <li>stefan höltgen established the concept of emulators as
        epistemic objects, as in, they are holding the functional
        description of the systems they emulate; at once readable by
        machines and humans</li>
        <li>In my own research I’m interested in the connection between
        technology and visuality of video games.</li>
        <li>I’d love to understand emulators better, and will have a
        first brief look from my perspective in the digital humanities
        and design research focusing on exploring the processes and
        implementations around graphics and video</li>
        <li>two methodologies: both focus on the source code; one is
        distant reading and one is close, or critical reading</li>
        <li>summarizing the results</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Distant reading
        <ul>
        <li>preparation of the corpus to split the files into code and
        comments</li>
        <li>throwing the source code at a common corpus analysis suite,
        such as voyant tools, created a mess</li>
        <li>! example: concentrating on comments and looking around a
        few keywords</li>
        <li>discussing the problem of creating patterns in a non-linear
        corpus</li>
        <li>landow hypertext: Though he was a consistent proponent of
        visual overviews and navigational maps, he long argued that
        hypertext navigation is not a problem—that hypertexts are not
        more difficult to understand than linear texts.
        <ul>
        <li>as a reaction to this problem I attempted to visualize the
        source code’s relationality through gephi</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>discussion translating the networked structure into a
        visualisation tool
        <ul>
        <li><code>#include</code> and source code as hypertext</li>
        <li>Relation between authors and source files and regarding
        active and past members</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Close reading
        <ul>
        <li>at first, i concentrate on the source code’s paratext, the
        comments, or the non-functional text
        <ul>
        <li>When trying to split the source code into code and comments,
        i encountered different License versions that I had to
        accomodate with my regex pattern</li>
        <li>! what kind of effect does the different license versioning
        have to the code base</li>
        <li>I was also very interested by the different ways code is
        commented and how those different styles give different access
        to the knowledge embeded in the code</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>as a last attempt I tried to read the source code of the
        video and graphic pipeline
        <ul>
        <li>admitting to not be fluent in C or the C64 architecture</li>
        <li>see points made in <a
        href="journal/2023-06-20.html">2023-06-20</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Discussion
        <ul>
        <li>i tried to create context and read VICE through it’s online
        available information, having a good look at the project
        structure, the involved people, the way knowledge is archived
        and accessed online</li>
        <li>what did I learn about VICE reading through it’s code?</li>
        <li>how can the digital humanities treat source code aside from
        close reading, what knowledge is gained from distant reading
        source code</li>
        <li>source code as hypertext, source code as cybertext
        (aarseth)</li>
        </ul></li>
