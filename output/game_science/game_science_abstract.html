        reading source code of a C64 emulator</h1>
        <p>Emulators are crucial to studying video games of the past.
        They imitate computing platforms and enable access to systems no
        longer produced and maintained. Most emulator projects are
        community-driven with a variety of approaches to accuracy and
        authenticity. Although being acknowledged as an influencing
        factor to the experience of video games, only little research
        has been done on the technical nature of emulators. This
        proposal will report on a first attempt to approach VICE, a C64
        emulator, through close and distant readings of its source code.
        Can we derive meaning from the technological base of software
        that is the technological base for our research on video
        games?</p>
