        Men and Violence in Digitals Games in the 1980s</h1>
        <p><strong>Ties to Ball Raider/DragonSlayer</strong> We recently
        worked on Ball Raider (1987), an Arkanoid/Breakout-style game
        that was developed in Switzerland and published in the United
        Kingdom<a href="/output/bare_chested_men.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Besides other details, the
        graphics of the game was a very important distinguishing
        feature. Whereas the orginial Arkanoid/Breakout games and their
        clones strived towards more minimal interfaces or the abstract,
        Ball Raider used illustrations as a backgrounds during
        gameplay.</p>
        <p>The game also features a character, that most likely was
        inspired by Dolf Lundgren in his role as He-Man in the movie
        Masters of the Universe, looking like the stereotypical 80s
        bare-chested barbarian. During our research on Ball Raider we
        came about the sarcastic blog post titled <a
        href="http://retrovania-vgjunk.blogspot.com/2015/09/amiga-title-screens-featuring-large.html">Amiga
        Title Screens Featuring Large Shirtless Men</a>, which included
        Ball Raider in its listing. At first we were amused, but quickly
        started to discuss the prevelance of this depiction within our
        research team. Why where there so many games (and movies) with
        bare-chested men? Was it a newfound erotic liberation after the
        1970s? Is this visual signifier important for the semantics of
        the game they accompany?</p>
        <p><strong>Methodological Approach</strong> It was too many
        games depicting bare-chested men to be ignored. We had at least
        two games in our own corpus having bare-chested barbarians in
        their visuality – Ball Raider and the unreleased DragonSlayer<a
        href="/output/bare_chested_men.html#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Using those two games as
        well as the above mentioned blog post as our vantage point, we
        set out to inquire this phenomena. To do so we followed roughly
        the following approach:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Definition of corpus: Which games do we include and for what
        reason</li>
        <li>Discourse analysis: Focus on two aspects – the visuality of
        the games and the reception of these in German
        game-magazins</li>
        <li>Merge findings: Bringing together the analysis</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The two aspects in the discourse analysis relate to the
        methods and approaches we bring in from our respective research
        backgrounds. Analysing the visuality included looking at
        screenshots, paratextual material, like covers and
        advertisement, but also inquiring other media that were relevant
        for this specific visual trope, such as movie posters, book
        covers and textual descriptions of characters. ==A note on the
        historical magazin approach?==</p>
        <p><strong>Selected Games</strong> After an initial scan of the
        relevant games, we came down to two clusters that we wanted to
        investigate:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Barbarians: <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1033/death-sword/">Barbarian
        I</a> (1987), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/12167/axe-of-rage/">Barbarian
        II</a> (1988), <a
        href="https://research.swissdigitization.ch/?p=613">DragonSlayer</a>
        (1989, unreleased), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/54344/torvak-the-warrior/">Torvak
        the Warrior</a> (1990), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6182/conan-the-cimmerian/">Conan
        the Cimmerian</a> (1991)</li>
        <li>Soldiers: <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1618/commando/">Commando</a>
        (1985), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6739/ikari-warriors/">Ikari
        Warriors</a> (1986), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/23105/leatherneck/">Leatherneck</a>
        (1988), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/16149/dogs-of-war/">Dogs of
        War</a> (1989)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What unites them is the implementation of the bare-chested
        man as main character(s), and as a visual item that is very
        present. The two clusters have a character design that is, in
        both cases, inspired by movies. In the first group we find
        <em>Conan: The Barbarian</em> as inspiration, and in the second
        we have <em>First Blood</em> (Rambo). Both movies came to the
        cinemas in 1982, and are based on writen stories.</p>
        <p><strong>Barbarians…</strong> Since we had two games refering
        to the Conan-styled barbarian in our corpus, I wanted to know
        more about where this visual discourse was coming from and
        concentrated on the first group in the following.</p>
        <p>After some initial discussion of the prevelance of the
        bare-chested barbarian, I came up with the following hypothesis
        regarding this specific visuality: <strong>The othering of these
        characters through the introduction of certain visual markers<a
        href="/output/bare_chested_men.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> with reference to the “noble
        savage” lays the moral ground for their violence and murdering.
        They do not have to abide by legal and moral guidelines outlined
        by their societies. This in turn enables the display and
        glorification of violence and a hypersexualisation of toxic
        masculinity in the games.</strong> This is a rather wild
        speculation and reality is of course more complex and messy then
        this three sentences can capture.</p>
        <p>As a first step towards knowing more I tried to build up a
        visual geneaology of Conan. I wanted to know why he looks the
        way he looks, where it started and how it changed over the
        years. I traced Conan back to his original author Robert E.
        Howard, an American writer who wrote pulp fiction stories. The
        first story with Conan as a main character was published in
        Weird Tales in 1932, titled <em>The Phoenix on the Sword</em>.
        In order to figure out how Howard imagined Conan, I used natural
        language processing on the original seventeen stories to extract
        visual descriptions of this character. Details on the process as
        well as the dataset can be found under the following DOI.</p>
        <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8320970"><img
        src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8320970.svg"
        alt="DOI" /></a> Two extracts from this analysis are exemplary
        for many other instances were Robert E. Howard was not shy to
        describe Conan in all his glory.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed,
        sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic
        melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of
        the Earth under his sandalled feet.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In strong contrast stood Conan, grim, blood-stained, naked
        but for a loin-cloth, shackles on his mighty limbs, his blue
        eyes blazing beneath the tangled black mane which fell over his
        low broad forehead.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Conan was never decribed in terms of cultural attributes or
        styles but in terms of physical attributes. This left
        illustration of this character more or less up to the artist’s
        imagination. In the 80 years that followed, depening on the
        artist, Conan leaned toward Greek mythology, Roman centurions,
        Celtic warriors, or middle eastern rogues. There are more
        details to this history, but of lesser importance here. A major
        development happend when the illustrator Frank Frazetta
        reimagined Conan in the 1970s. Whereas former Conans leaned
        towards the elegant and statue-like, Frazetta’s version was
        grim, pumped and dynamic. This version of Conan came together
        with other developments in the media industry, from cinema and
        comics.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The success of Star Wars in 1977 increased Hollywood’s
        interest in producing films that portray “heroic adventures in
        supernatural lands of fables”. The film industry’s attention was
        drawn to the popularity of Conan among young male Americans, who
        were buying reprints of the stories with Frank Frazetta’s art
        and adaptations by Marvel Comics.<a href="/output/bare_chested_men.html#fn4"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>…and Violence</strong> We finally arrive in the
        1980s, with the two Conan movies being a success. Next to being
        a surprise for Universal Pictures, it also showcased Arnold
        Schwarzenegger and found a pletora of swords-and-sorcery movies
        throughout that decade. It is also the decade were our first
        Conan-styled game got developed and published, <em>Barbarian:
        The Ultimate Warrior</em> (1987). The Wikipedia entry on the
        game has an interesting anecdote on the development of the
        game.<a href="/output/bare_chested_men.html#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In 1985, Palace Software hired Steve Brown as a game designer
        and artist. […] He was inspired by Frank Frazetta’s fantasy
        paintings to create a sword fighting game that was “brutal and
        as realistic as possible”. Brown based the game and its
        characters on the Conan the Barbarian series, having read all of
        Robert E. Howard’s stories of the eponymous warrior.</p>
