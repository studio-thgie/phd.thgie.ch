        <li>since video game images not only have aesthetical and
        narrative aspects, but also functional, traditional image
        analysis struggles with its vocabulary.
        <ul>
        <li>video game images are not only narrative devices, like in
        movies, where they apply visual information and aesthetics in
        order to communicate a story or invoke affects. the images of
        video games also have to convey game states, for example lives
        or where one is at the moment in relation to the overall game,
        bringing them closer to user interfaces. and, most importantly,
        video game images also have to communicate participation and
        interaction possibility. they have to tell you what you can or
        must do, as a player, in order to proceed.</li>

        <li>favr as an attempt to structure video game graphics by their
        functional, material and formal aspects, enabling structuring of
        large corpora with completely different games and the analysis

        <li><p>video game graphics are digital-born objects, results of
        software-instructions and hardware-calculations. despite easy
        digital access, the digitality and techno-historic limits of
        video game images has not been well researched yet. video game
        graphics are more often than not treated like any other image,
        without taking their specifics into account.</p></li>

        Analysis of Visual Representation in <del>Video Games, coming
        from the University of Montreal in Canada. I’m working on
        bringing this framework from media analysis to the digital
