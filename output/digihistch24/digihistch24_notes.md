## Notes
### 2023-09-22
The timing would be quite right for the paper on [Historical research on the visuality of older digital games in Switzerland](output/expose.md#Work%20Package%202%20–%202.%20half%202024). They drop the AI and algorithm keyword a few times without being very specific about it. I will certainly not touch that. But the focus on the methodological interplay of close and distant reading would be perfect for a design-research/digital-humanities approach. I also think that proposing a paper on historical research of a digital-born image corpus can give me an advantage. There is not to much of such things going on.
