## Notes
### 2023-11-01
> Submit an abstract of no more than 300 words that clearly outlines the title, purpose, methodology, findings, and implications of your research project, research method, software, data, or tool.
> "Historical Research, Digital Literacy and Algorithmic Criticism". We are particularly interested in papers that address ongoing research projects, innovative research methods, the use of software in historical research, data analysis, and digital tools.
> Papers should provide insightful analysis, provoke thoughtful discussion, and contribute to the understanding and advancement of digital literacy and algorithmic criticism in historical research.
> title, purpose, methodology, findings, and implications of your research project, research method, software, data, or tool

- algorithmic criticism
	- video game graphics as results of soft- and hardware, digital-born
- digital literacy
	- how do we read and analyse video game graphics
	- something about the long tradition of image research (qualitative) and digital approaches beyond cultural analytics (quantitative, metadata) -> the interplay of close and distant reading in image analysis
- historical research
	- defined by corpus

The timing would be quite right for the paper on [Historical research on the visuality of older digital games in Switzerland](output/expose.md#Work%20Package%202%20–%202.%20half%202024). They drop the AI and algorithm keyword a few times without being very specific about it. I will certainly not touch that. But the focus on the methodological interplay of close and distant reading would be perfect for a design-research/digital-humanities approach. I also think that proposing a paper on historical research of a digital-born image corpus can give me an advantage. There is not to much of such things going on.
