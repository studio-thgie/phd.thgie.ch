# A critical reading of a C64 emulator's source code

Emulators are crucial to studying video games of the past. They imitate computing platforms and enable access to systems no longer produced and maintained. Most emulator projects are community-driven with a variety of approaches to accuracy and authenticity. Although being acknowledged as an influencing factor to the experience of video games, only little research has been done on the technical nature of emulators. This proposal will report on a first attempt to approach VICE, a C64 emulator, through close and distant readings of its source code. Can we derive meaning from the technological base of software that is the technological base for our research on video games?
