## 1. Introduction and problem statement
Video games are manifestations of designerly intentions, which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into a product. People of all trades, from code to graphics, thus transform their knowledge and skills into a playable and meaningful experience. But as cultural products, video games communicate much more than these design intentions. They also integrate unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and ideologies.

This is equally true for the visuality of the video game, on which this proposal is concentrating. To analyse this, I will present an approach to a critical and close reading of the transformation of code to images. Drawing on critical code analysis and discourse analysis, I combine methodologies from design research and the digital humanities. Critical readings serve the purpose of unearthing and dissecting power structures and the generation of meaning in and from our cultural artefacts. Such readings open up our research objects to a plethora of interpretations.

The images in video games differ from paintings or photographs. They are not materially fixed in time-space, but procedurally generated in the moment of play. If we take a closer look at the image of video games and accept it as an artefact that is calculated and constructed by code and computer hardware, we must conclude that the underlying technology is formative for its discourse and meaning. Respectively, that programmers and graphic designers alike are significantly involved in the circulation and formation of meanings and power relations through the image in video games.

Research on the visuality of video games largely ignores the interplay and interconnection of visuality and its technological underlayer. There seems to be a hard to bridge gap, a momentum where the description of images is transformed into the visuality of video games. It's a moment where meaning is transfered from one system of signifiers (code) into another (visuality), from one sphere of disciplines to another. This calls for an approach depending on interactional expertise. Coming from design research I am interested into how these two spheres are part of a whole, being created by people with intentions and having effects.

Visuality in video games is traditionally analysed through a media-theoretical approach. A lot of the vocabulary to do so has come from the studies of images in general (gill rose), but specifically from film studies, since it was the medium closest to video games. New approaches try to find their own language to analyse and describe images (favr), criticising the approach up to new as unfit to encompass the diversity of visuality in video games. Contemporary analysis takes the video games visuality procedural nature into account (Birken, Bogost)

Literature that inquires the technicality of the image in video games often focuses on what the hardware or software is able to do functionally. It deals with questions of memory, and how the developers fit the sprites into it, the amounts and ranges of colors, or how the same game looked different on different computing systems because of the different technicalities.

A few exceptions were able to bridge the gap, linking technicalities and visualities as well as going into the details of intentions and effects. *Making the Water Move* makes the case for how two digital games, developed and released simultaneously, both having the same goals regarding their visual design, ended up looking differently.

This literature builds the backbone of my proposal. I am not merely interested in function or form, but mostly in the intentions put into place as well as the effects they created. This is why a semiological, discourse critical and design rhetorical approach is necessary, applied on the technicalities as well as the visulity of video games.

### 2.2 Frameworks
- Classic approaches to studying visuality in the video game
	- Formal
	- Discourse, Social
	- Rhetoric

### 2.3 Research gap
- Methods for studying visuality largly ignore the images material basis 
- The visuality in video games has a fundamentally different material basis
- Visuality in games was much more manual work then today; the tools were less elaborate and more technical knowledge was needed

Based on my assumptions, it is my hypothesis that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of video game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole.

Coding for visuality involves multimodal design. The code written and the output generated by that code does not correlate aesthetically. The brief moment of translation, from one system of signifiers into another happens already in the coders mind (or knowledge) before the computational act itself. There is a double rhetoric at play, one for the code, one for the visuality.

I am essentially interested in the transformation or translation of meaning from one system of signifiers into another. The materiality of visuality in video games is only on the surface comparable to paint in the painting. It is much closer to artworks where the artist wrote instructions. The basis of the image in video games is of textual nature, and as such opens it self to being analysed like a literal text.

## 4. Objectives and research questions
This proposal will present a unifying methodological approach to inquire meaning-making and discourse in the image of video games as well as its underlying code, from which it emanates. As such, code is treated as a meaningful paratext to video games studies and is approached through critical code analysis methods. The proposed framework is tested on the corpus from the Confederatio Ludens research project, which focuses on video games from Switzerland from the 1980ies and 1990ies.

### 4.1 Objectives
This dissertation has the following interlocking research objectives.

#### 4.1.1 Historical design analysis of Swiss video games
This objective connects the dissertation with the research project Confederatio Ludens and its research goal of analysing the history of Swiss video game design and development. The focus is laid on the discourse analysis of the image material. The goal is to identify flows and novelties, popcultural references and visual discourse regarding the visuality and how those relate to the concept of Switzerland as a historic unity.

Part of this research objective is the creation of two corpora. The first consists of the digital games that are researched in the Confoederatio Ludens project. The project will maintain it's own dataset, hosted on the Swiss Games Garden platform, which consists of a Drupal installation and a custom frontend. In order to uphold FAIR/CARE principles, I will maintain a duplicate dataset on Wikidata. Being linked-data and graph-based, Wikidata will enable some machine-assisted research approaches, such as visualising networks of actors.

The second corpus consists of visual material regarding the digital games from the games list. The images will mainly be taken directly from the games according to a strategy laid out later. Since the focus of the dissertation is on the interplay of code and image, paratextual material such as box arts or advertisement will only be collected for case studies. The collection strategy includes formal elements, game content and is further build on the Game FAVR (Arsenault et al., 2015).

#### 4.1.2 Bridging the analysis of visuality and technology in video games
Stepping fully into my own dissertation I want to bridge the analysis of two different domains. Code and visuality are interrelated and part of the feedback loop of gaming machine and player. This objective is distinguished by being research on a methodological approach, the goal being testing and examining the possibilities of a joined analysis of the two halves of this proposed whole.

#### 4.1.3 Discourse on multimodality of coding for visuality
The third objective wants to research the consequences, impact and effects of momentum of transformation from code to visuality. If code and image are interrelated in terms of meaning and discourse, video game developers working on technical aspects have to be inquired in terms of their power to shape the image discourse. Think of how pixels and glitches entered our aesthetic vocabulary. This object is gearing towards a media-theoretical approach that expands Vilém Flussers concept of the *technical image* towards video games.

It is hardly possible to see beyond the horizon of transformation from code to image. Looking at the visuality one can only make assumption about the code and vice versa. This has a profound impact on designing visuality through code.

### 4.2 Research questions
To what extend are the technological foundations of video games and their visuality entangled? Can they be treated as separate domains, or do they have to be read as paratexts to each other? Are they on a semiological continuum, or is there a shift of expression at the moment of transformation from code to image? Can a games code be read meaningful towards the image that it emenates? How does this class of creatives structure the image in video games?

## 5.  Research design and methodology
### 5.1 Research data
The research base material is built by two corpora – the digital games list and it's metadata, and visual material regarding those games. Whereas I am actively working collaboratively with the research team on the former, I am solely responsible for the latter. From this base material I will choose a reasonable number of exemplary games, which could be around 20 starting from experiences in similar projects. Exemplary means that some of the games stand in for popular genres of the time, while some others can't be put in such a schema.

### 5.2 Methodology
- Literature analysis
- Multimodal discourse analysis
- Design rhetoric
- Critical code analysis
- HGP Methods
- Case studies
- Interviews with original developers
- Corpus building and analysis w/ DH methods (network, images)

#### 5.2.x Corpora building and analysis
The image corpus is built following a strategy to include as much material as is necessary to fully represent a games' aesthetics and content. Next to formal elements, a list of the visual content of a game the Game FAVR model of categorisation of the visuality of a digital game can help to obtain the right material.

- Formal Elements: Color schemes, typography, compositions
- Content: Levels, sprites and characters
- FAVR: Visual modes, ocularizations, framing mechanisms, construction of tangible space

### 5.3 Possible problems
In the following I will reflect on possible weaknesses in outlined research design as well as how to mitigate the risks.

#### 5.3.1 Critical code analysis
Although researching context is key to this methodology, it's main focus is source code. In the case of old digital games, such source code can be hard to obtain. Problems can arise for example if the original developers can't be contacted, don't want to share their code base or don't have it anymore. It is certain that some source code can be found, although maybe not of the originally targeted games. As a fallback, games from beyond the scope of the corpus could be enlarged to find material for this approach.

It is one of this dissertations appeals to open data: In order to study digital games, we need not only their compiled version, but also their raw source material, their game code.

#### 5.3.2 Image reception
As a historical analysis, research into the reception of the image, an important aspect of design rhetoric, is limited. This shortcoming can be balanced by the Horror-Game-Politics method, which is a source-critical approach that builds on research into the  context.
