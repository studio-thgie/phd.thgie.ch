## 1. Introduction and problem statement
Digital games are manifestations of designerly intentions, which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into an output. These games communicate much more than the intentioned designs. They also capture unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and ideologies, as well as historical contexts. This is equally true for the visuality of the video game, on which this proposal is concentrating. 

In my thesis I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the research on the image of the digital game and its material base. The image of digital games brings with its own specificities. The constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from the hardware's calculation. It is interactive and as such holds within itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing itself upon the player's input. Research on the image of digital games more often than not focuses either on the constituted and visible image, or its material basis – either on visuality or technology.

Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of digital game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent from digital humanities, design research and video game studies and assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical reading the visuality of digital games. Such an approach opens up our research objects to a plethora of interpretations and new insights.

### 1.1 Visuality
In using the term visuality I depend on the definitions brought forward by Gillian Rose. Here, visuality refers to the socio-cultural construction of how and what we see (Rose, 2016). I'm building on these descriptions as I am mainly interested in the image as a medium of communication, a semiotic device that attempts to transport meaning, and using rhetorics to transform intentions into affects. Coming from design rhetorics, I am interested in how designers and developers of games encoded meaning and rhetoric into the images, as well as the effects of these onto the players. Gillian Rose herself is building upon the work by Hal Foster, who defined visuality as the "how we see, how we are able, allowed, or made to see, and how we see this seeing and the unseeing therein". This relates the term visuality to the slightly more complex scopic regime (Jay, 2008). 

### 1.2 (Historical) Visuality in digital games
As in every other medium, the visuality in digital games has its own specifics. Being of high relevancy to this dissertation, I'll try to outline two of them in the following: ergodicity and techno-historic limits.

Digital games are especially demanding of their consumers as the medium relies on a high level of participation. The difference between reading a book, watching a film or playing a digital game was especially well captured by Espen Aarseth's application of ergodicity in his book Cybertext. Coming from literature studies, Aarseth speaks of a "nontrivial effort [that] is required to allow the reader to traverse the text" (Aarseth, 1997). This needed effort does not guarantee an exhaustive capture of the played game or a successful play-through. The player creates a path through the configuration of a textual machine, by participating in the game.

This ergodicity is an important aspect when considering the image visible on the screen. The image represents one possible state, defined by the elements that the designers of the game provided, configured by the player's participation. At the same moment, the image on screen communicates choices for the player, who then can reconfigure it by acting within the game. The image holds its own future possibilities by being within a feedback loop between itself and the player. The above outlined process happens in parallel to the communicative features of the image, which can also speak of information relevant to the game's state, such as highscores or player lives, as well as transporting narratives that are creating context and experience for the player. 

The second aspect of heightened relevance is the relationship between the image and its technological structures, from which it springs forth. Being digital born, the image in digital games is depending on hardware and software in order to be seen. These can be considered the material aspect of visuality in digital games. Analog to Aarseth's coining of cybertext, Stefan Möring applies the term cyberimage to denote the images dependance on its underlying technological structures as well as the player's interaction with the machine (Gerling et al., 2022). 

Todays digital games playing devices are powerful computers and myriad of softwares and frameworks aid in the development and design. Game design in the early days of game development looked quite different. The capabilities of computers were fairly limited and the technical realisation of the games had to be done in early programming languages, such as Basic or Assembler dialects. This circumstances form the techno-historic limits of early digital game design and directly influenced formal and semiotic aspects of those games' visuality (Hutchison, 2008). These limits as well as the intimate interplay between the technological foundation as a semiotic system in itself and the visible image will be considered in this dissertation through the application of critical code analysis (Marino, 2020).

### 2.2 Research gap
#### On-screen visuality in digital games, and its materiality
Based on my assumptions, it is my hypothesis that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of video game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole.

Coding for visuality involves multimodal design. The code written and the output generated by that code does not correlate aesthetically. The brief moment of translation, from one system of signifiers into another happens already in the coders mind (or knowledge) before the computational act itself. There is a double rhetoric at play, one for the code, one for the visuality.

I am essentially interested in the transformation or translation of meaning from one system of signifiers into another. The materiality of visuality in video games is only on the surface comparable to paint in the painting. It is much closer to artworks where the artist wrote instructions. The basis of the image in video games is of textual nature, and as such opens it self to being analysed like a literal text.

### 2.3 Own research #todo
My recent case studies have helped in formulating my research focus as well as the questions I'm interested in. In the following I want to highlight three of these cases: working on digital games corpora, analysing the visuality of games, and critically reading source code.

#### 2.3.1 Corpora
In order to analyse my digital-born research objects, I have to create and maintain several corpora. More information on this dissertations material is outlined under 4.2.2. I was able to already start this process in the case of metadata regarding our list of digital games, as well as an image archive.

The work on metadata involved collaboratively working on a digital games list for the German-speaking countries[^1], being involved in the maintenance and development of Swiss Games Garden[^2], and importing our games metadata into Wikidata[^3]. The work on the metadata corpus was oriented towards pragmatically working with the data, and as such, is a work in progress. The metadata needs further refinements and has to be expanded. This case helped in getting an overview of what data is present and in which quality it can be aquired.

A lot of consideration has went into the image archive[^4]. The archive is focused on screenshots from our games corpus and some of their paratextual material. The considerations on how to structure and create such a corpus as well as the practical work on collecting the images has helped tremendously to get a basic idea of what image material will be available for the analysis through distant reading and design rhetorics. The methods are outlined under 4.2.

Part of the work in the image corpus was the development of an ontology to apply in Tropy, based on FAVR.

#### 2.3.2 Design Rhetoric
I have been able to carry out two case studies regarding design rhetorics. The first focused on analysing the visuality of a specific game, and the second on a visual trope in digital games from the 1980ies.

In the first case study I had a good look at the images from Ball Raider[^5], a game developed in Switzerland and published in 1987. The analysis found its way into an upcoming post on the Confoederatio Ludens blog[^6].  The close reading of the visuality of the game helped form a hypothesis on the game, as well as its developers and designers. Part of the analysis was an interview with the graphic artist, as well as looking at formal and semantic aspects of the images present in the game. This case study initiated an inquiry into the visual trope of the bare chested barbarian, which emerged in the 80ies.

This second inquiry focused on a handful of digital games that were not development in Switzerland, but have been formative for the design of later games. The output of this analysis[^7] will find its way into a post for the Confoederatio Ludens blog. The study is done in collaboration with Aurelia Brandenburg, who is also a PhD-student and researcher in the project I take part. While she is focusing on the games reviews, I'll try to investigate, why those games barbarian characters look like they do, as well as that looks effect on meaning-making. I developed a first hypothesis, was able to trace the historical development of the visual trope and made first attempts in combining close and distant reading of visual material. 

I have collected the material used in this case study in a repository.

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8315806.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8315806)
Both studies helped in getting a better understanding of design rhetoric.

#### 2.3.3 Critical Code Analysis
The last case study was an attempt to critically read the source code of an Emulator[^8], VICE for the Commodore 64. The intent for this exploration was twofold – figuring out what kind of text source code is and using it as the epistemological lense to research a project and its contextuality. I tried again to combine close and distant reading. Hermeneutic distant reading of source code is not an established practice, and I considered this approach experimental.

The work on this inquiry helped me get a better view on the possibilities and shortcomings of critical code analysis. This method is key to my research and is outlined in 4.2. Especially experimenting with a distant reading approach was fruitful to see what kind of text source code is. The results of this study found their way into an upcoming book, published by a working group around the AG Spiele of the DHd.

Scripts and output of this study are collected in their own repository.

## 3. Objectives and research questions

### 3.1 Objectives
This dissertation has the following interlocking research objectives.

#### 3.1.1 Historical design analysis of the visuality of Swiss video games #todo
This objective connects the dissertation to the research project Confederatio Ludens and its research goal of analysing the history of Swiss video game design and development. The focus is laid on the analysis of the image material. The goal is to identify flows and novelties, popcultural references and visual discourse regarding the visuality and how those relate to Switzerland as a historic unity.

Part of this research objective is the creation of three corpora, which I outline and detail under 4.2.2.

#### 3.1.2 Bridging the analysis of visuality and technology in video games #todo
Stepping fully into my own dissertation I want to bridge the analysis of two different domains. Code and visuality are interrelated and part of the feedback loop of gaming machine and player. This objective is distinguished by being research through a methodological approach, the goal being testing and examining the possibilities of a joined analysis of the two halves of this proposed whole.

- this needs to be expanded

#### 3.1.3 Discourse on multimodality of coding for visuality #todo

- this needs rewritting: focus on the designerly act 

The third objective wants to research the consequences, impact and effects of momentum of transformation from code to visuality. If code and image are interrelated in terms of meaning and discourse, video game developers working on technical aspects have to be inquired in terms of their power to shape the image discourse. Think of how pixels and glitches entered our aesthetic vocabulary. This object is gearing towards a media-theoretical approach that expands Vilém Flussers concept of the *technical image* towards video games.

It is hardly possible to see beyond the horizon of transformation from code to image. Looking at the visuality one can only make assumption about the code and vice versa. This has a profound impact on designing visuality through code.

### 3.2 Research questions
To what extend are the technological foundations of video games and their visuality entangled? Can they be treated as separate domains, or do they have to be read as paratexts to each other? Are they on a semiological continuum, or is there a shift of expression at the moment of transformation from code to image? Can a games code be read meaningful towards the image that it emanates?

## 4.  Research design and methodology
### 4.1 Research data
The research base material is built by two corpora – the digital games list and it's metadata, and visual material regarding those games. Whereas I am actively working collaboratively with the research team on the former, I am solely responsible for the latter. From the base material games list corpus I will choose a reasonable number of exemplary as well as exceptional games. Exemplary means that some of the games stand in for popular genres of the time, while some others can't be put in such a schema. Further information on the corpora is outline in 4.2.2.

### 4.2 Methodology
The following outlines the methods I will apply.

#### 4.2.1 Literature Review
Relevant literature has been covered in point 2.1. The literature review was key to identify the research gap outlined in point 2.2. Further literature review will be conducted towards visuality in video games from a media theoretical perspective as well as the notion of text regarding program code.

#### 4.2.2 Corpora building and analysis
In this dissertation project, I will help building and maintaining three different corpora.

1. A comprehensive list of Swiss digital games until the year 2000 and their accompanying metadata, such as factual information, computing systems, genre, and actors involved in the development and distribution
2. A catalog of images containing visual material for the games in the first corpus
3. An archive of source code from the games in the first corpus

##### Metadata
The first consists of the digital games that are researched in the Confoederatio Ludens project. The project will maintain it's own dataset, hosted on the Swiss Games Garden platform, which consists of a Drupal installation and a custom frontend. In order to uphold FAIR/CARE principles, I will maintain a duplicate dataset on Wikidata. Being linked-data and graph-based, Wikidata will enable some machine-assisted research approaches, such as visualising networks of actors.

##### Images
The second corpus consists of visual material regarding the digital games from the games list. The images will mainly be taken directly from the games according to a predefined strategy, as well as collected from online archives. The strategy is to include as much material as is necessary to fully represent a games' aesthetics and content. Next to formal elements, a list of the visual content of a game the Game FAVR (see 2.1) model of categorisation of the visuality of a digital game can help to obtain the right material. Since the focus of the dissertation is on the interplay of code and image, paratextual material such as box arts or advertisement will only be collected for case studies.

- Formal Elements: Color schemes, typography, compositions
- Content: Levels, sprites and characters
- FAVR: Visual modes, ocularizations, framing mechanisms, construction of tangible space
- Relevant paratexts: Box art, manuals, advertisement, etc.

##### Source code
As mentioned in 1. and 3.1.2, the source code of the researched games is of special interest to me. Critical code analysis treats code not only as functional instructions to a machine, but also as a text that can be hermeneutically approached and semiotically read (Marino, 2020). Further, from the perspective of design theory, a digital game is a second order design (Willumsen, 2016). The game developers don't design the game, they design the structures that generate the game. Akin to the writing aid for an author, like pens or keyboards, source code has formal and structural influence on the what and how the game developers design. Taken together, these two approaches outline source code as a carrier of meaning, as well as the tools and material for designing games. This makes source code a core focus of my dissertation.

Working with source code can be difficult. Source code is text, but can reach levels of abstraction down to being a string of seemingly random alpha-numeric strings, in the case of Assembler. A certain level of knowledge and experience is needed to fruitfully dive into source code with close readings. I have made first attempts in critical code analysis, as mentioned under 2.3.3. Distant readings, in which the digital humanities are especially strong, are yet to be established when approaching source code hermeneutically. 

In order to read source code, one needs to obtain such, which is another difficulty. It is yet to be seen, if we will be able to acquire the source code of the games we research. Games written in Basic, which is not compiled to machine code, as well as magazine listings have their source code directly accessible. But, these games only make a small portion of our corpus. In the case of games that were compiled, and where the source code is not directly accessible, we are dependent on the personal archives of the game developers. Decompiling the games is a possible approach, but the produced source code is an interpretation by the machine and not comparable to the original code written by the developers. Further thoughts on this problematic can be found in 4.4.1. 

Archiving digital game source code could be done easily, for example by setting up version control repositories. Working with source code academically is another problem. Legal issues, access rights, longterm archiving, referencing specific pieces of code in publications, and other issues arise. This dissertation will not be able to tackle all of them, but use the source code corpus pragmatically.

---

All three corpora are built and maintained with FAIR/CARE principles in mind. The metadata in the corpus on Swiss digital games will be regularly published as linked open data on Wikidata. The catalog of images will be worked on in Tropy and disseminated in an Omeka archive, as well as on Zenodo. The archive of source code has no clear long-term path yet, but efforts are being made to create sustainable digital games archives in Switzerland. Cooperation with these archives is desirable.

#### 4.2.3 Horror Game Politics Method
The HGP method is a historical, source-critical approach to studying video games, which focuses on analysing production, product, and reception. Developed by Eugen Pfister and Arno Görgen, this method aids in reconstructing the original context through production- and reception analysis.

Since I will study the visuality as well as the source code of digital games mainly from the 1980ies and 1990ies it is important to situate the analysis properly in its historical context. The HGP method is building on Roland Barthes approach to myth-making, and was applied to reading into the political myth of horror games. This aspect of the HGP method will help me in the discourse analysis of case studies, outlined in 4.2.6.

#### 4.2.5 Design rhetoric #todo
- I feel that design rhetorics is a key methods in bringing technology and visuality together. There is a beautiful tension between the intentions of the developers and graphic artists, that are deposited into the source code, and the affects created in the image on screen.

#### 4.2.6 Critical code analysis
Critical code analysis describes source code for software not only as functional instructions for machines, but also as cultural artefacts written by humans for humans, akin literature. This means, that source code could potentially be read in order to acquire knowledge about socio-cultural and historical contexts. To what extend source code can be treated as a literary text, or leaning more on the Foucauldian notion of text, has been tested and described in 2.4.4. First preliminary results indicate that source code is rich in knowledge, but difficult to access through digital humanities distant readings approaches.


### 4.4 Theoretical frameworks #todo
- Design rhetorics
- Cybertext- and image

### 4.4 Possible problems
In the following I will reflect on possible weaknesses in outlined research design as well as how to mitigate the risks.

#### 4.4.1 Critical code analysis
Although researching context is key to this methodology, it's main focus is source code. In the case of old digital games, such source code can be hard to obtain. Problems can arise for example if the original developers can't be contacted, don't want to share their code base or don't have it anymore. It is certain that some source code can be found, although maybe not of the originally targeted games. As a fallback, games from beyond the scope of the corpus could be enlarged to find material for this approach. Being able to research the interplay of technology and visuality in our Swiss digital games corpus would be the best possible outcome. 

It is one of this dissertations appeals to open data: In order to study digital games, we need not only their compiled version, but also their raw source material, their game code (Konzack, 2002; Willumsen, 2016).

#### 4.4.2 Image reception
As a historical analysis, research into the reception of the image, an important aspect of design rhetoric, is limited. This shortcoming can be balanced by the Horror-Game-Politics method, which is a source-critical approach that builds on research into the  context.
