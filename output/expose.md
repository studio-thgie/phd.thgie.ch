## 1. Introduction and problem statement
Digital games are manifestations of designerly intentions, which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into an output. These games communicate much more than the intentioned designs. They also capture unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and ideologies, as well as historical contexts. This is equally true for the visuality of the video game, on which this proposal is concentrating. 

In my thesis I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the research on the image of the digital game and its material base. The image of digital games brings with its own specificities. The constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from the hardware's calculation. It is interactive and as such holds within itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing itself upon the player's input. Research on the image of digital games more often than not focuses either on the constituted and visible image, or its material basis – either on visuality or technology.

Although the specifics of the digital game's visuality have been anticipated and considered, as outlined in 2.1, no in-depth research has been conducted on the interplay and entanglement of a games technological structuring through source code and the image seen on screen.

Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of digital game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent from digital humanities, design research and video game studies and assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical reading the visuality of digital games. Such an approach opens up our research objects to a plethora of interpretations and new insights.

### 1.1 Visuality
In using the term visuality I depend on the definitions brought forward by Gillian Rose. Here, visuality refers to the socio-cultural construction of how and what we see [@roseVisualMethodologiesIntroduction2016]. I'm building on these descriptions as I am mainly interested in the image as a medium of communication, a semiotic device that attempts to transport meaning, and using rhetorics to transform intentions into affects. Coming from design rhetorics, I am interested in how designers and developers of games encoded meaning and rhetoric into the images, as well as the effects of these onto the players. Gillian Rose herself is building upon the work by Hal Foster, who defined visuality as the "how we see, how we are able, allowed, or made to see, and how we see this seeing and the unseeing therein". This relates the term visuality to the slightly more complex scopic regime [@jayScopicRegime2008]. 

### 1.2 (Historical) Visuality in digital games
As in every other medium, the visuality in digital games has its own specifics. Being of high relevancy to this dissertation, I'll try to outline two of them in the following: ergodicity and techno-historic limits.

Digital games are especially demanding of their consumers as the medium relies on a high level of participation. The difference between reading a book, watching a film or playing a digital game was especially well captured by Espen Aarseth's application of ergodicity in his book Cybertext. Coming from literature studies, Aarseth speaks of a "nontrivial effort [that] is required to allow the reader to traverse the text" [@aarsethCybertextPerspectivesErgodic1997]. This needed effort does not guarantee an exhaustive capture of the played game or a successful play-through. The player creates a path through the configuration of a textual machine, by participating in the game.

This ergodicity is an important aspect when considering the image visible on the screen. The image represents one possible state, defined by the elements that the designers of the game provided, configured by the player's participation. At the same moment, the image on screen communicates choices for the player, who then can reconfigure it by acting within the game. The image holds its own future possibilities by being within a feedback loop between itself and the player. The above outlined process happens in parallel to the communicative features of the image, which can also speak of information relevant to the game's state, such as highscores or player lives, as well as transporting narratives that are creating context and experience for the player. 

The second aspect of heightened relevance is the relationship between the image and its technological structures, from which it springs forth. Being digital born, the image in digital games is depending on hardware and software in order to be seen. These can be considered the material aspect of visuality in digital games. Analog to Aarseth's coining of cybertext, Stefan Möring applies the term cyberimage to denote the images dependance on its underlying technological structures as well as the player's interaction with the machine [@gerlingScreenImagesInGame2022]. 

Todays digital games playing devices are powerful computers and myriad of softwares and frameworks aid in the development and design. Game design in the early days of game development looked quite different. The capabilities of computers were fairly limited and the technical realisation of the games had to be done in early programming languages, such as Basic or Assembler dialects. This circumstances form the techno-historic limits of early digital game design and directly influenced formal and semiotic aspects of those games' visuality. These limits as well as the intimate interplay between the technological foundation as a semiotic system in itself and the visible image will be considered in this dissertation through the application of critical code analysis [@marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020].

### 2.2 Research gap
Based on my assumptions, it is my hypothesis that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of video game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole.

Coding for visuality involves multimodal design. The code written and the output generated by that code does not correlate aesthetically. The brief moment of translation, from one system of signifiers into another happens already in the coders mind (or knowledge) before the computational act itself. There is a double rhetoric at play, one for the code, one for the visuality.

I am essentially interested in the transformation or translation of meaning from one system of signifiers into another. The materiality of visuality in video games is only on the surface comparable to paint in the painting. It is much closer to artworks where the artist wrote instructions. The basis of the image in video games is of textual nature, and as such opens it self to being analysed like a literal text.

This dissertation proposal extends on Vilèm Flusser's technical image, a theory that states that the development of visual technologies drive towards more abstraction and alienation in the production of images [@flusserUniverseTechnicalImages2011]. He included digital images, but did not work on visuality that was produced through computer code.

Further reading is provided in *3. Objectives and research questions*.

### 2.3 Own research
My recent case studies have helped in formulating my research focus as well as the questions I'm interested in. In the following I want to highlight three of these cases: working on digital games corpora, analysing the visuality of games, and critically reading source code.

#### 2.3.1 Corpora
In order to analyse my digital-born research objects, I have to create and maintain several corpora. More information on this dissertations material is outlined under 4.2.2. I was able to already start this process in the case of metadata regarding our list of digital games, as well as an image archive.

The work on metadata involved collaboratively working on a digital games list for the German-speaking countries[^1], being involved in the maintenance and development of Swiss Games Garden[^2], and importing our games metadata into Wikidata[^3]. The work on the metadata corpus was oriented towards pragmatically working with the data, and as such, is a work in progress. The metadata needs further refinements and has to be expanded. This case helped in getting an overview of what data is present and in which quality it can be aquired.

A lot of consideration has went into the image archive[^4]. The archive is focused on screenshots from our games corpus and some of their paratextual material. The considerations on how to structure and create such a corpus as well as the practical work on collecting the images has helped tremendously to get a basic idea of what image material will be available for the analysis through distant reading and design rhetorics. The methods are outlined under 4.2.

Part of the work in the image corpus was the development of an ontology to apply in Tropy, based on FAVR.

#### 2.3.2 Design Rhetoric
I have been able to carry out two case studies regarding design rhetorics. The first focused on analysing the visuality of a specific game, and the second on a visual trope in digital games from the 1980ies.

In the first case study I had a good look at the images from Ball Raider[^5], a game developed in Switzerland and published in 1987. The analysis found its way into an upcoming post on the Confoederatio Ludens blog[^6].  The close reading of the visuality of the game helped form a hypothesis on the game, as well as its developers and designers. Part of the analysis was an interview with the graphic artist, as well as looking at formal and semantic aspects of the images present in the game. This case study initiated an inquiry into the visual trope of the bare chested barbarian, which emerged in the 80ies.

This second inquiry focused on a handful of digital games that were not development in Switzerland, but have been formative for the design of later games. The output of this analysis[^7] will find its way into a post for the Confoederatio Ludens blog. The study is done in collaboration with Aurelia Brandenburg, who is also a PhD-student and researcher in the project I take part. While she is focusing on the games reviews, I'll try to investigate, why those games barbarian characters look like they do, as well as that looks effect on meaning-making. I developed a first hypothesis, was able to trace the historical development of the visual trope and made first attempts in combining close and distant reading of visual material. 

I have collected the material used in this case study in a repository.

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8315806.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8315806)

Both studies helped in getting a better understanding of design rhetoric.

#### 2.3.3 Critical Code Analysis
The last case study was an attempt to critically read the source code of an Emulator[^8], VICE for the Commodore 64. The intent for this exploration was twofold – figuring out what kind of text source code is and using it as the epistemological lense to research a project and its contextuality. I tried again to combine close and distant reading. Hermeneutic distant reading of source code is not an established practice, and I considered this approach experimental.

The work on this inquiry helped me get a better view on the possibilities and shortcomings of critical code analysis. This method is key to my research and is outlined in 4.2. Especially experimenting with a distant reading approach was fruitful to see what kind of text source code is. The results of this study found their way into an upcoming book, published by a working group around the AG Spiele of the DHd.

Scripts and output of this study are collected in their own repository.

## 3. Objectives and research questions

### 3.1 Objectives
This dissertation has the following interlocking research objectives.

#### 3.1.1 Historical design analysis of the visuality of Swiss video games
This objective connects the dissertation to the research project Confederatio Ludens and its research goal of analysing the history of Swiss video game design and development. The focus is laid on the analysis of the image material. The goal is to identify flows and novelties, popcultural references and visual discourse regarding the visuality and how those relate to Switzerland as a historic unity. This dissertation adds to the interdisciplinary research project by sharing it's findings. Part of this research objective is the creation of three corpora, which I outline and detail under 4.2.2.

#### 3.1.2 Bridging the analysis of visuality and technology in video games
This dissertation attempts to bridge the analysis of two different domains, which is the second research objective. Code and visuality are interrelated and part of the feedback loop of gaming machine and player. This objective is distinguished by being researched through a methodological approach, the goal being testing and examining the possibilities of a joined analysis of the two halves of this proposed whole. 

The main discourse in video game research played out on a spectrum between the game's narrative or ludic qualities. Analyses geared either towards games being literature or a bundle of play mechanics. Only recently has the approach of games as images gain some traction again [@fizekLudicGlassMaking2022; @gerlingScreenImagesInGame2022]. A major takeaway from the disciplines origin story, the dispute between narratology and ludology, was the need for interdisciplinary approaches in order for a fuller analysis of digital games.

Next to furthering the studies on visuality in digital games, this research object attempts to bridge inquiries on the images seen on screen with and analysis of the images' underlying structures, the code that generates them. The underlying thoughts were outlined in *1. Introduction and problem statement*.

#### 3.1.3 Discourse on multimodality of coding for visuality
It is hardly possible to see beyond the horizon of transformation from code to image. Looking at the visuality one can only make assumption about the code and vice versa. This has a profound impact on designing visuality through code.

The design theoretician Vilém Flusser thought extensively on the way we produce images. He started to differentiate between traditionally handmade images and technical images, which where produced through technical means, like an apparatus. A key aspect of technical images is the abstraction between designing and the designed. Instead of drawing an image by hand, where the act of drawing and the result on paper are aesthetically intertwined, the designer of an image operates technical means, that in turn then produce the image. Flusser's work included digitality, especially photography, but did not extend to the study of creative coding, or the visual design of digital games through programming.

The third objective wants to research this specific mode of visual designing through programming, as well as the consequences, impact and effects of this momentum of transformation from code to visuality. This means, that will tie into Flusser's theory on the technical image and use that vantage point to inquiry this concept in the context of digital games visuality.

### 3.2 Research interest
My interests focus not only on the how technical and visual aspects entangle in the image of video games, but also why designers pursue such an approach over other media.

I have followed a programming practice spanning at least two decades. My interest got sparked by the realisation that the things visible on screen are produced by code. Next to being a professional software developer, I have extensively inquired coding as a creative practice. This vantage point led to a career with coding on one side and design studies on the other. This path culminates in this dissertation. I want to do research on visuality, thinking analysing underlying technologies and the visible image together. I am particularly interested in programming to create images, as a designerly act, and how working in one modality (abstract code) influences the other modality (the visible image). The image in the game has properties that can be found in dynamic data visualisation or creative coding and is a fitting study object to satisfy my interests.

Frameworks such as Design By Numbers[^10] (and its successor Processing) or Graphics BASIC[^11] aimed to make programming accessible as a design tool. The end product of such a practice, which are graphics, can be defined as second order design [@willumsenSourceCodeFormal2016]. The designers who work with code primarily design this code or the resulting program, which in turn generates the graphics. Programming is often presented as a purely technical act, which has to do with the level of abstraction of code as well as the understanding of machines [@marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020]. However, the act of programming is far more chaotic, riddled with frustration, accompanied by debugging of incomprehensible errors, and, most importantly, complexities that elude a single human being. The acquisition and virtuos execution of creative coding takes years and a high tolerance for frustration.

### 3.3 Research questions
To what extend are the technological foundations of video games and their visuality entangled? Can they be treated as separate domains, or do they have to be read as paratexts to each other? Are they on a semiological continuum, or is there a shift of expression at the moment of transformation from code to image? Can a games code be read meaningful towards the image that it emanates?

- How do game developers use programming to create the visual design of digital games, and what are the implications of this approach for the relationship between technology and aesthetics in game design?
- How does the interplay between the technological limits of digital game development and the reception of the image influence the generation of meaning for players, and what are the implications of this interplay for game design?
- In what ways do game designers and developers encode meaning and rhetoric into the images of digital games, and how do these choices affect players' emotions and perceptions?
- How has the concept of "visuality" in digital games evolved over time, and what are the specific characteristics that differentiate it from other forms of visual media?
- What role does ergodicity play in shaping the visuality of digital games, and how does it affect players' engagement with the game's images and narratives?
- How has the technological evolution of digital game development tools and hardware influenced the visual design and material aspects of digital games, and how have these changes impacted the semiotics of game imagery?
- What are the techno-historic limits that early digital game design faced, and how did these limits shape the formal and semiotic aspects of the visuality of early digital games?
- How can critical code analysis be applied to better understand the relationship between the technological foundation of digital games and the visible image, and what insights can this approach provide into the development of game visuals?

## 4.  Research design and methodology
### 4.1 Research data
The research base material is built by two corpora – the digital games list and it's metadata, and visual material regarding those games. Whereas I am actively working collaboratively with the research team on the former, I am solely responsible for the latter. From the base material games list corpus I will choose a reasonable number of exemplary as well as exceptional games. Exemplary means that some of the games stand in for popular genres of the time, while some others can't be put in such a schema. Further information on the corpora is outline in 4.2.2.

### 4.2 Methodology
The following outlines the methods I will apply.

#### 4.2.1 Literature Review
Relevant literature has been covered in point 2.1. The literature review was key to identify the research gap outlined in point 2.2. Further literature review will be conducted towards visuality in video games from a media theoretical perspective as well as the notion of text regarding program code.

#### 4.2.2 Corpora building and analysis
In this dissertation project, I will help building and maintaining three different corpora.

1. A comprehensive list of Swiss digital games until the year 2000 and their accompanying metadata, such as factual information, computing systems, genre, and actors involved in the development and distribution
2. A catalog of images containing visual material for the games in the first corpus
3. An archive of source code from the games in the first corpus

##### Metadata
The first consists of the digital games that are researched in the Confoederatio Ludens project. The project will maintain it's own dataset, hosted on the Swiss Games Garden platform, which consists of a Drupal installation and a custom frontend. In order to uphold FAIR/CARE principles, I will maintain a duplicate dataset on Wikidata. Being linked-data and graph-based, Wikidata will enable some machine-assisted research approaches, such as visualising networks of actors.

##### Images
The second corpus consists of visual material regarding the digital games from the games list. The images will mainly be taken directly from the games according to a predefined strategy, as well as collected from online archives. The strategy is to include as much material as is necessary to fully represent a games' aesthetics and content. Next to formal elements, a list of the visual content of a game the Game FAVR (see 2.1) model of categorisation of the visuality of a digital game can help to obtain the right material. Since the focus of the dissertation is on the interplay of code and image, paratextual material such as box arts or advertisement will only be collected for case studies.

- Formal Elements: Color schemes, typography, compositions
- Content: Levels, sprites and characters
- FAVR: Visual modes, ocularizations, framing mechanisms, construction of tangible space
- Relevant paratexts: Box art, manuals, advertisement, etc.

##### Source code
As mentioned in 1. and 3.1.2, the source code of the researched games is of special interest to me. Critical code analysis treats code not only as functional instructions to a machine, but also as a text that can be hermeneutically approached and semiotically read [@marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020]. Further, from the perspective of design theory, a digital game is a second order design [@willumsenSourceCodeFormal2016]. The game developers don't design the game, they design the structures that generate the game. Akin to the writing aid for an author, like pens or keyboards, source code has formal and structural influence on the what and how the game developers design. Taken together, these two approaches outline source code as a carrier of meaning, as well as the tools and material for designing games. This makes source code a core focus of my dissertation.

Working with source code can be difficult. Source code is text, but can reach levels of abstraction down to being a string of seemingly random alpha-numeric strings, in the case of Assembler. A certain level of knowledge and experience is needed to fruitfully dive into source code with close readings. I have made first attempts in critical code analysis, as mentioned under 2.3.3. Distant readings, in which the digital humanities are especially strong, are yet to be established when approaching source code hermeneutically. 

In order to read source code, one needs to obtain such, which is another difficulty. It is yet to be seen, if we will be able to acquire the source code of the games we research. Games written in Basic, which is not compiled to machine code, as well as magazine listings have their source code directly accessible. But, these games only make a small portion of our corpus. In the case of games that were compiled, and where the source code is not directly accessible, we are dependent on the personal archives of the game developers. Decompiling the games is a possible approach, but the produced source code is an interpretation by the machine and not comparable to the original code written by the developers. Further thoughts on this problematic can be found in 4.4.1. 

Archiving digital game source code could be done easily, for example by setting up version control repositories. Working with source code academically is another problem. Legal issues, access rights, longterm archiving, referencing specific pieces of code in publications, and other issues arise. This dissertation will not be able to tackle all of them, but use the source code corpus pragmatically.

---

All three corpora are built and maintained with FAIR/CARE principles in mind. The metadata in the corpus on Swiss digital games will be regularly published as linked open data on Wikidata. The catalog of images will be worked on in Tropy and disseminated in an Omeka archive, as well as on Zenodo. The archive of source code has no clear long-term path yet, but efforts are being made to create sustainable digital games archives in Switzerland. Cooperation with these archives is desirable.

#### 4.2.3 Horror Game Politics Method
The HGP method is a historical, source-critical approach to studying video games, which focuses on analysing production, product, and reception. Developed by Eugen Pfister and Arno Görgen, this method aids in reconstructing the original context through production- and reception analysis.

Since I will study the visuality as well as the source code of digital games mainly from the 1980ies and 1990ies it is important to situate the analysis properly in its historical context. The HGP method is building on Roland Barthes approach to myth-making, and was applied to reading into the political myth of horror games. This aspect of the HGP method will help me in the discourse analysis of case studies.

#### 4.2.5 Design rhetoric (Bern model)
Design rhetoric examines the rhetorical principles in designed artefacts regarding their effects. Rhetorical design analysis according to the Bern model attempts to bridge the gap between a close study of designed objects and the discourse (social, political, psychological) that they interact with. This approach then tries to bring together intimate expert-knowledge on why things are designed as they are and how these designs relate to and shape the world at large.

Design rhetoric is at once interested in the designing, the designed and the effects of both. It as an interdisciplinary approach that draws from interactional expertise, the ability to converse expertly in more than one discipline [@collinsRethinkingExpertise2009]  and bridging formal analysis, hermeneutics and collaborative elicitation.  There is a tension between the intentions of the developers and graphic artists, that are deposited into the source code, and the affects created in the image on screen. Design rhetoric's interdisciplinary approach is in favour of bringing together these two separate domains.

#### 4.2.6 Critical code analysis
Critical code analysis describes source code for software not only as functional instructions for machines, but also as cultural artefacts written by humans for humans, akin literature. This means, that source code could potentially be read in order to acquire knowledge about socio-cultural and historical contexts. To what extend source code can be treated as a literary text, or leaning more on the Foucauldian notion of text, has been tested and described in 2.4.4. First preliminary results indicate that source code is rich in knowledge, but difficult to access through digital humanities distant readings approaches.

### 4.3 Theoretical position
The theoretical vantage point of this dissertation will be Vilém Flusser's theory of the technical image. In his thinking he started to differentiate between "traditional" and "technical" images [@flusserUniverseTechnicalImages2011]. The former are the result of a cultural evolution, in which we started to translate direct experience of the world into two-dimensional representation of this experience. The latter, "technical" images, have been introduced a few steps later and are produced through textual descriptions. They do not necessarily represent anymore, but are constructed and construct. The "technical" image thus alienates the viewer from direct experience and creates its own world.

Flusser was a contemporary media analyst the theoretician who inquired new media up to the rise of the computer. Home computers, and with them the rise of programming practices  beyond the university, and video game cultures came after his seminal work, and have not been included in the analysis. His work can be ascribed to critical theory, as he did not only ponder on the subject, but also warn of possible problems arising from the rise of the "technical" image.

Flusser's theoretical approach will be expanded by Marino's theories on code as a cultural artefact [@marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020]. Critical code analysis is not only a methodological approach but also a theoretical perspective, in which code is not only textual instruction for machines. Code is also a socio-cultural artefact that can be approached through hermeneutics. Code is comprehended not just by programmers, but also by lawyers, artists, pundits, journalists, political activists, and literary scholars. Its utility extends beyond mere programming and finds application in political discourse, artistic creations, popular culture, and the documentation of history.

### 4.4 Possible problems
In the following I will reflect on possible weaknesses in outlined research design as well as how to mitigate the risks.

#### 4.4.1 Critical code analysis
Although researching context is key to this methodology, it's main focus is source code. In the case of old digital games, such source code can be hard to obtain. Problems can arise for example if the original developers can't be contacted, don't want to share their code base or don't have it anymore. It is certain that some source code can be found, although maybe not of the originally targeted games. As a fallback, games from beyond the scope of the corpus could be enlarged to find material for this approach. Being able to research the interplay of technology and visuality in our Swiss digital games corpus would be the best possible outcome. 

It is one of this dissertations appeals to open data: In order to study digital games, we need not only their compiled version, but also their raw source material, their game code [@konzackComputerGameCriticism2002; @willumsenSourceCodeFormal2016].

#### 4.4.2 Image reception
As a historical analysis, research into the reception of the image, an important aspect of design rhetoric, is limited. This shortcoming can be balanced by the Horror-Game-Politics method, which is a source-critical approach that builds on research into the  context.

### 5.2 Detailed Schedule
The following timetables are rough, but doable estimates. The transition from one task to another is of course closer to a threshold or gradient, and can shift in time needed.

#### Work Package 0 – 2023-2024
WP0 is reserved for getting a good overview, set the focus, working on the expose, attaining the necessary ECTS points. Part of working on the expose are case studies to inquire focus-related and methodological questions. The case studies are listed under 2.3.

#### Work Package 1 – 1. half 2024
WP1 concentrates on the discipline of digital humanities as well as the building, maintaining, and analysing of an image corpus regarding the visuality of digital games. The corpus was a case study and is outlined in 2.3.1. 

- Questions: What kind of knowledge can an image corpus on digital games generate? What kind of knowledge is lost in the process (see ergodicity)? What are the infrastructural necessities to enable distant and close readings of the image corpus?
- Publishing medium: tbd
- Schedule
	- 1 month: Building corpus
	- 3 month: Analysing through distant and close reading methods
	- 2 month: Writeup findings, publish and rewrite

Part of this work package is the start of a digital edition, that enables the exploration of the image corpus, as well as other data relevant to my dissertation. This edition could stand on it's own, or be structured to fit a specific publication. 

#### Work Package 2 – 2. half 2024
WP2 shifts to the HGP-method as well as design rhetorics, see 4.2.3. I will define three case studies in which I will analyse the visuality of one digital game, or a group of games, within their historical contexts. The goal is to identify flows and novelties, popcultural references and visual discourse regarding the visuality and how those relate to Switzerland as a historic unity.

- Questions: What is the specific visuality of digital games made in Switzerland? What kind of influences did it take up, propagate, and what kind of elements did it add to the discourse?
- Publishing medium: tbd
- Schedule
	- 1 month: Defining case studies
	- 3 month: One month per case study, analysing the digital game(s) through mentioned method and the images collected in WP1
	- 2 month: Writeup findings, publish and rewrite

#### Work Package 3 – 1. half 2025
WP3 focuses on a corpus which will take time to create, that is, the archive holding the source code of the games. The collection of, or search for, digital games source code will start as early as possible. In most cases this material will be found through the original developers, if the source code has been preserved at all. Alternative ways to obtain source code will be considered as well. For example decompressing the games when they were written with Basic, which does not compile. The source code archive will be worked through digital humanities distant reading approaches, such as corpus analysis, as well as close reading attempts and critical code analysis.

- Questions: How can we work academically with digital games' source code? How does source code behave as corpus and archival material? What kind of text is source code and how can digital humanities distant reading approach handle it?
- Publishing medium: tbd
- Schedule:
	- 2 month: Building of source code archive
	- 2 month: Distant and close reading analysis of source code
	- 2 month: Writeup findings, publish and rewrite

#### Work Package 4 – 2. half 2025
WP4 combines work done in the previous work packages and attempts to unify several methodological approaches (distant reading, close reading, design rhetorics, critical code analysis). The aim of this work package is to inquire the original hypothesis and questions regarding the invisible rift between the research on the image of the digital game and its material base, as well as my assumption that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of digital game development and the reception of the image. I will define three case studies of digital games of which I have material in my image corpus and source code archive, and apply said method in combination of methodological results from former work packages. To this end, findings from WP2 and WP3 will be combined and extended. 

- Questions: To what extend are the technological foundations of video games and their visuality entangled? Can they be treated as separate domains, or do they have to be read as paratexts to each other? Are they on a semiological continuum, or is there a shift of expression at the moment of transformation from code to image? Can a games code be read meaningful towards the image that it emanates?
- Publishing medium: tbd
- Schedule:
	- 1 month: Defining case studies
	- 3 month: One month per case study, analysing the digital game(s) through outlined approach
	- 2 month: Writeup findings, publish and rewrite

#### Work Package 5 – 2026-2027
WP5 focuses on wrapping up the publishing process and writing the dissertation. Next to the accepted papers, I will need to add an overarching thread, as well introduction and discussion to my dissertation.
