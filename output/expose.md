## 1. Introduction and problem statement
>Du beschreibst konkret dein Thema in Form einer Erörterung des Problems.
- Research on visuality concentrates on either the technology or the image
- Explain the specific nature of visuality in video games

Video games are manifestations of designerly intentions, which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into a product. People of all trades, from code to graphics, thus transform their knowledge and skills into a playable and meaningful experience. But as cultural products, video games communicate much more than these design intentions. They also integrate unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and ideologies.

This is equally true for the visuality of the video game, on which this proposal is concentrating. To analyse this, I will present an approach to a critical and close reading of the transformation of code to images. Drawing on critical code analysis and discourse analysis, I combine methodologies from design research and the digital humanities. Critical readings serve the purpose of unearthing and dissecting power structures and the generation of meaning in and from our cultural artefacts. Such readings open up our research objects to a plethora of interpretations.

The images in video games differ from paintings or photographs. They are not materially fixed in time-space, but procedurally generated in the moment of play. If we take a closer look at the image of video games and accept it as an artefact that is calculated and constructed by code and computer hardware, we must conclude that the underlying technology is formative for its discourse and meaning. Respectively, that programmers and graphic designers alike are significantly involved in the circulation and formation of meanings and power relations through the image in video games.

Research on the visuality of video games largely ignores the interplay and interconnection of visuality and its technological underlayer. There seems to be a hard to bridge gap, a momentum where the description of images is transformed into the visuality of video games. It's a moment where meaning is transfered from one system of signigiers (code) into another (visuality), from one sphere of disciplines to another. This calls for an approach depending on interactional expertise. Coming from design research I am interested into how these two spheres are part of a whole, being created by people with intentions and having effects.

Visuality in video games is traditionally analysed through a media-theoretical approach. A lot of the vocabulary to do so has come from the studies of images in general (gill rose), but specifically from film studies, since it was the medium closest to video games. New approaches try to find their own language to analyse and describe images (favr), critisising the approach up to new as unfit to encompass the diversity of visuality in video games. Contemporary analysis takes the video games visuality procedural nature into account (Birken, Bogost)

		Literature that inquires the technicality of the image in video games often focuses on what the hardware or software is able to do functionally. It deals with questions of memory, and how the developers fit the sprites into it, the amounts and ranges of colors, or how the same game looked different on different computing systems because of the different technicalities.

A few exceptions were able to bridge the gap, linking technicalities and visualities as well as goind into the details of intentions and effects.

This literature builds the backbone of my proposal. I am not merely interested in function or form, but mostly in the intentions put into place as well as the effects they created. This is why a semiological, discourse critical and design rhetorical approach is necessary, applied on the technicalities as well as the visulity of video games.

### 2.2 Frameworks
- Ansätze Visualität im Video Spiel zu studieren
	- Formal
	- Diskurse

### 2.3 Research gap
- Methods for studying visuality largly ignore the images material basis 
- The visuality in video games has a fundamentally different material basis

Based on these assumptions, it is my hypothesis that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of video game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole.

- > why study the paint

I am essentially interested in the transformation or translation of meaning from one system of signifiers into another. The materiality of visuality in video games is only on the surface comparable to paint in the painting. It is much closer to artworks where the artist wrote instructions. The basis of the image in video games is of textual nature, and as such opens it self to being analysed like a literal text.

## 3. Theoretical background
> Aufbauend auf deinen Recherchen beschreibst du den theoretischen Rahmen deiner Problemstellung.

- Semiology und Diskurs Analyse
- Design Rhetoric

## 4. Objectives and research questions
> Aufbauend auf der Problemstellung, dem Stand der Forschung und dem theoretischen Hintergrund formulierst du das [Ziel deiner Dissertation](https://www.scribbr.de/category/dissertation-doktorarbeit/). Hast du das Ziel definiert, kannst du eine Hauptforschungsfrage und mehrere Unterfragen formulieren, um es zu erreichen.

This proposal will present a unifying methodological approach to inquire meaning-making and discourse in the image of video games as well as its underlying code, from which it emanates. As such, code is treated as a meaningful paratext to video games studies and is approached through critical code analysis methods. The proposed framework is tested on the corpus from the Confederatio Ludens research project, which focuses on video games from Switzerland from the 1980ies and 1990ies.

### 4.1 Objectives
- develop approach that brings together the study of visuality in video games as well as its technological foundation
- historical design analysis
- better understand the media-theoretical momentum of transformation from code to visuality

### 4.2 Research questions
To what extend are the technological foundations of video games and their visuality entangled? Can they be treated as separate domains, or do they have to be read as paratexts to each other? Are they on a semiological continuum, or is there a shift of expression at the moment of transformation from code to image? Can a games code be read meaningful towards the image that it emenates?
