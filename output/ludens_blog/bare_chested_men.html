        Men and Violence in Digital Games in the 1980s</h1>
        <p>We recently worked on Ball Raider (1987), an
        Arkanoid/Breakout-style game that was developed in Switzerland
        and published in the United Kingdom<a href="/output/ludens_blog/bare_chested_men.html#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Besides other details, the
        graphics of the game was a significant distinguishing feature.
        Whereas the original Arkanoid/Breakout games and their clones
        strived towards more minimal interfaces or the abstract, Ball
        Raider used illustrations as backgrounds during gameplay.</p>
        <p>The game also features a character, that most likely was
        inspired by Dolf Lundgren in his role as He-Man in the film
        Masters of the Universe, looking like the stereotypical 80s
        bare-chested barbarian. During our research on Ball Raider we
        came about the sarcastic blog post titled <a
        href="http://retrovania-vgjunk.blogspot.com/2015/09/amiga-title-screens-featuring-large.html">Amiga
        Title Screens Featuring Large Shirtless Men</a>, which included
        Ball Raider in its listing. At first, we were amused, but
        quickly started to discuss the prevalence of this depiction
        within our research team. Why were there so many games (and
        movies) with bare-chested men? Was it a newfound erotic
        liberation after the 1970s? Is this visual signifier important
        for the semantics of the game they accompany?</p>
        <h2 id="methodological-approach">Methodological Approach</h2>
        <p>There were too many games depicting bare-chested men to be
        ignored. We also had at least two games in our own corpus having
        bare-chested barbarians in their visuality – Ball Raider and the
        unreleased DragonSlayer<a href="/output/ludens_blog/bare_chested_men.html#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Using those two
        games as well as the above-mentioned blog post as our vantage
        point, we set out to inquire these phenomena. This “we” includes
        Aurelia Brandenburg and Adrian Demleitner. To do so we followed
        roughly the following approach:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Definition of general inquiry</li>
        <li>Definition of corpus: Which games do we include and for what
        reason</li>
        <li>Discourse analysis: Focus on two aspects – the visuality of
        the games and the reception of these in German video game
        magazines</li>
        <li>Merge our findings: Bringing together the analysis</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The two aspects in the discourse analysis relate to the
        methods and approaches we bring in from our respective research
        backgrounds. Analysing the visuality included looking at
        screenshots, paratextual material, like covers and
        advertisements, but also inquiring other media that were
        relevant for this specific visual trope, such as film posters,
        book covers and textual descriptions of characters.</p>
        <h2 id="selected-games">Selected Games</h2>
        <p>After an initial scan of the relevant games, we came down to
        two clusters that we wanted to investigate:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Barbarians: <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1033/death-sword/">Barbarian
        I</a> (1987), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/12167/axe-of-rage/">Barbarian
        II</a> (1988), <a
        href="https://research.swissdigitization.ch/?p=613">DragonSlayer</a>
        (1989, unreleased), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/54344/torvak-the-warrior/">Torvak
        the Warrior</a> (1990), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6182/conan-the-cimmerian/">Conan
        the Cimmerian</a> (1991)</li>
        <li>Soldiers: <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1618/commando/">Commando</a>
        (1985), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6739/ikari-warriors/">Ikari
        Warriors</a> (1986), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/23105/leatherneck/">Leatherneck</a>
        (1988), <a
        href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/16149/dogs-of-war/">Dogs of
        War</a> (1989)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What unites them is the implementation of the bare-chested
        man as main character(s), and as a visual item that is very
        present. The two clusters have a character design that is, in
        both cases, inspired by movies. In the first group we find
        <em>Conan: The Barbarian</em> as inspiration, and in the second
        we have <em>First Blood</em> (Rambo). Both movies came to the
        cinemas in 1982, and are based on written stories that got
        published in magazines or books.</p>
        <h2 id="barbarians">Barbarians</h2>
        <p>Since we had two games referring to the Conan-styled
        barbarian in our corpus, I<a href="/output/ludens_blog/bare_chested_men.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> wanted to know
        more about where this visual discourse was coming from and
        concentrated on the first group in the following.</p>
        <p>After some initial discussion of the prevalence of the
        bare-chested barbarian with my research peers, I came up with
        the following hypothesis regarding this specific visuality:
        <strong>The othering of these characters through the
        introduction of certain visual markers<a href="/output/ludens_blog/bare_chested_men.html#fn4"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> with reference to the “noble
        savage” lays the moral ground for their violence and murdering.
        They do not have to abide by legal and moral guidelines outlined
        by their societies. This in turn enables the display and
        glorification of violence and a hypersexualisation of toxic
        masculinity in the games.</strong> This is a rather wild
        speculation, and reality is, of course, more complex and messy
        then these three sentences can capture.</p>
        <p>As a first step towards knowing more, I tried to build up a
        visual genealogy of Conan. I wanted to know why he looks the way
        he looks, where it started and how it changed over the years. I
        traced Conan back to his original author, Robert E. Howard, an
        American writer who wrote pulp fiction stories. The first story
        with Conan as a main character was published in Weird Tales in
        1932, titled <em>The Phoenix on the Sword</em><a href="/output/ludens_blog/bare_chested_men.html#fn5"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. To figure out how Howard
        imagined Conan, I used natural language processing on the
        original seventeen stories to extract visual descriptions of
        this character. Details on the process, as well as the dataset,
        can be found via <a
        href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8320970"><img
        src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8320970.svg"
        alt="DOI" /></a>.</p>
        <p>Two extracts from this analysis are exemplary of many other
        instances where Robert E. Howard was not shy to describe Conan
        in all his glory.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed,
        sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic
        melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of
        the Earth under his sandalled feet.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In strong contrast stood Conan, grim, blood-stained, naked
        but for a loin-cloth, shackles on his mighty limbs, his blue
        eyes blazing beneath the tangled black mane which fell over his
        low broad forehead.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Conan was never described in terms of cultural attributes or
        styles but in terms of physical attributes. This left the
        illustration of this character more or less up to the artist’s
        imagination. In the 80 years that followed up to 2023, depending
        on the artist, Conan leaned toward Greek mythology, Roman
        centurions, Celtic warriors, or middle eastern rogues. There are
        more details to this history, but of lesser importance here. The
        relevant change in Conan’s visuality happened when the
        illustrator Frank Frazetta reimagined Conan in the 1970s.
        Whereas former Conan’s leaned towards the elegant and
        statue-like, Frazetta’s version was grim, pumped and dynamic.
        This version of Conan came together with other developments in
        the media industry, in cinema and comics.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The success of Star Wars in 1977 increased Hollywood’s
        interest in producing films that portray “heroic adventures in
        supernatural lands of fables”. The film industry’s attention was
        drawn to the popularity of Conan among young male Americans, who
        were buying reprints of the stories with Frank Frazetta’s art
        and adaptations by Marvel Comics.<a href="/output/ludens_blog/bare_chested_men.html#fn6"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We finally arrive in the 1980s, with the two Conan movies
        being a success. Next to being a surprise for Universal
        Pictures, it also showcased Arnold Schwarzenegger and inspired a
        plethora of swords-and-sorcery movies throughout that decade. It
        is also the decade were our first Conan-styled game got
        developed and published, <em>Barbarian: The Ultimate
        Warrior</em> (1987). The Wikipedia entry on the game has an
        interesting anecdote on the development of the game.<a
        href="/output/ludens_blog/bare_chested_men.html#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In 1985, Palace Software hired Steve Brown as a game designer
        and artist. […] He was inspired by Frank Frazetta’s fantasy
        paintings to create a sword fighting game that was “brutal and
        as realistic as possible”. Brown based the game and its
        characters on the Conan the Barbarian series, having read all of
        Robert E. Howard’s stories of the eponymous warrior.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>One cannot simply analyse the images of these games for their
        violence. Looking at these games almost 40 years after their
        publication, their attempt to be brutal seems ridiculous.
        Nonetheless, have they been received as violent and discussed as
        such. Context matters. Visuality is a socio-cultural
        construction of how and what we see <span class="citation"
        data-cites="roseVisualMethodologiesIntroduction2016">(Rose
        2016)</span>, and our eyes have witnessed a lot more violence
        since. Formally, a few red pixels sufficed to indicate a
        character being wounded, whereas today we have hyperreal
        depictions and glorifications of all kinds of violence.</p>
        <p>Jakob Birken recently expanded on the topic of aesthetics,
        realism and historical reception regarding video game graphics.
        <span class="citation"
        data-cites="birkenIllusionAlsVersprechen2023">(Birken
        2023)</span> (Hier ein zwei, drei gute Sätze zu/aus seinem
        Aufsatz.)</p>
        <p>Whereas the inquired wargames have very similar game
        graphics, the cluster with the barbarian games encompasses a
        much broader variety of aesthetics. Within this variance, newer
        is not necessarily “better”. From my subjective perspective, the
        formal elements making up Barbarian “work” better in
        communicating violence, compared to Torvak or Conan. The latter
        two tend to skewed perspectives and cartoonishly pumped main
        characters, which is also a sign of their time. A popular style
        among Amiga games included bubbly and rounded aesthetics.
        Barbarian, on the other hand, had to work with limited colours
        and lower resolution.</p>
        <p>The history of depicting violence in video games is also a
        history of the development of the visual symbol as a signifier
        of violence to the realistic reproduction of the signified. A
        handful of red pixels are hardly recognisable as blood, but they
        indicate such, they carry that meaning. The red pixels are
        closer to the word than to resembling blood. In this light, the
        considerations that went into the banning or censoring of these
        games are especially interesting.</p>
