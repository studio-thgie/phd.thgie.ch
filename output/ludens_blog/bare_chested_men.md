# Bare-Chested Men and Violence in Digital Games in the 1980s

We recently worked on Ball Raider (1987), an Arkanoid/Breakout-style game that was developed in Switzerland and published in the United Kingdom[^1]. Besides other details, the graphics of the game was a significant distinguishing feature. Whereas the original Arkanoid/Breakout games and their clones strived towards more minimal interfaces or the abstract, Ball Raider used illustrations as backgrounds during gameplay.

The game also features a character, that most likely was inspired by Dolf Lundgren in his role as He-Man in the film Masters of the Universe, looking like the stereotypical 80s bare-chested barbarian. During our research on Ball Raider we came about the sarcastic blog post titled [Amiga Title Screens Featuring Large Shirtless Men](http://retrovania-vgjunk.blogspot.com/2015/09/amiga-title-screens-featuring-large.html), which included Ball Raider in its listing. At first, we were amused, but quickly started to discuss the prevalence of this depiction within our research team. Why were there so many games (and movies) with bare-chested men? Was it a newfound erotic liberation after the 1970s? Is this visual signifier important for the semantics of the game they accompany?

## Methodological Approach
There were too many games depicting bare-chested men to be ignored. We also had at least two games in our own corpus having bare-chested barbarians in their visuality – Ball Raider and the unreleased DragonSlayer[^2]. Using those two games as well as the above-mentioned blog post as our vantage point, we set out to inquire these phenomena. This "we" includes Aurelia Brandenburg and Adrian Demleitner. To do so we followed roughly the following approach:

1. Definition of general inquiry
2. Definition of corpus: Which games do we include and for what reason
3. Discourse analysis: Focus on two aspects – the visuality of the games and the reception of these in German video game magazines
4. Merge our findings: Bringing together the analysis

The two aspects in the discourse analysis relate to the methods and approaches we bring in from our respective research backgrounds. Analysing the visuality included looking at screenshots, paratextual material, like covers and advertisements, but also inquiring other media that were relevant for this specific visual trope, such as film posters, book covers and textual descriptions of characters.

## Selected Games
After an initial scan of the relevant games, we came down to two clusters that we wanted to investigate:

- Barbarians: [Barbarian I](https://www.mobygames.com/game/1033/death-sword/) (1987), [Barbarian II](https://www.mobygames.com/game/12167/axe-of-rage/) (1988), [DragonSlayer](https://research.swissdigitization.ch/?p=613) (1989, unreleased), [Torvak the Warrior](https://www.mobygames.com/game/54344/torvak-the-warrior/) (1990), [Conan the Cimmerian](https://www.mobygames.com/game/6182/conan-the-cimmerian/) (1991)
- Soldiers: [Commando](https://www.mobygames.com/game/1618/commando/) (1985), [Ikari Warriors](https://www.mobygames.com/game/6739/ikari-warriors/) (1986), [Leatherneck](https://www.mobygames.com/game/23105/leatherneck/) (1988), [Dogs of War](https://www.mobygames.com/game/16149/dogs-of-war/) (1989)

What unites them is the implementation of the bare-chested man as main character(s), and as a visual item that is very present. The two clusters have a character design that is, in both cases, inspired by movies. In the first group we find *Conan: The Barbarian* as inspiration, and in the second we have *First Blood* (Rambo). Both movies came to the cinemas in 1982, and are based on written stories that got published in magazines or books.

## Barbarians
Since we had two games referring to the Conan-styled barbarian in our corpus, I[^3] wanted to know more about where this visual discourse was coming from and concentrated on the first group in the following.

After some initial discussion of the prevalence of the bare-chested barbarian with my research peers, I came up with the following hypothesis regarding this specific visuality: **The othering of these characters through the introduction of certain visual markers[^4] with reference to the "noble savage" lays the moral ground for their violence and murdering. They do not have to abide by legal and moral guidelines outlined by their societies. This in turn enables the display and glorification of violence and a hypersexualisation of toxic masculinity in the games.** This is a rather wild speculation, and reality is, of course, more complex and messy then these three sentences can capture.

As a first step towards knowing more, I tried to build up a visual genealogy of Conan. I wanted to know why he looks the way he looks, where it started and how it changed over the years. I traced Conan back to his original author, Robert E. Howard, an American writer who wrote pulp fiction stories. The first story with Conan as a main character was published in Weird Tales in 1932, titled *The Phoenix on the Sword*[^5]. To figure out how Howard imagined Conan, I used natural language processing on the original seventeen stories to extract visual descriptions of this character. Details on the process, as well as the dataset, can be found via [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8320970.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8320970).

Two extracts from this analysis are exemplary of many other instances where Robert E. Howard was not shy to describe Conan in all his glory.

> Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet.

> In strong contrast stood Conan, grim, blood-stained, naked but for a loin-cloth, shackles on his mighty limbs, his blue eyes blazing beneath the tangled black mane which fell over his low broad forehead.

Conan was never described in terms of cultural attributes or styles but in terms of physical attributes. This left the illustration of this character more or less up to the artist's imagination. In the 80 years that followed up to 2023, depending on the artist, Conan leaned toward Greek mythology, Roman centurions, Celtic warriors, or middle eastern rogues. There are more details to this history, but of lesser importance here. The relevant change in Conan's visuality happened when the illustrator Frank Frazetta reimagined Conan in the 1970s. Whereas former Conan's leaned towards the elegant and statue-like, Frazetta's version was grim, pumped and dynamic. This version of Conan came together with other developments in the media industry, in cinema and comics.

> The success of Star Wars in 1977 increased Hollywood's interest in producing films that portray "heroic adventures in supernatural lands of fables". The film industry's attention was drawn to the popularity of Conan among young male Americans, who were buying reprints of the stories with Frank Frazetta's art and adaptations by Marvel Comics.[^6]

We finally arrive in the 1980s, with the two Conan movies being a success. Next to being a surprise for Universal Pictures, it also showcased Arnold Schwarzenegger and inspired a plethora of swords-and-sorcery movies throughout that decade. It is also the decade were our first Conan-styled game got developed and published, *Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior* (1987). The Wikipedia entry on the game has an interesting anecdote on the development of the game.[^7]

> In 1985, Palace Software hired Steve Brown as a game designer and artist. […] He was inspired by Frank Frazetta's fantasy paintings to create a sword fighting game that was "brutal and as realistic as possible". Brown based the game and its characters on the Conan the Barbarian series, having read all of Robert E. Howard's stories of the eponymous warrior.

## Discussion
One cannot simply analyse the images of these games for their violence. Looking at these games almost 40 years after their publication, their attempt to be brutal seems ridiculous. Nonetheless, have they been received as violent and discussed as such. Context matters. Visuality is a socio-cultural construction of how and what we see [@roseVisualMethodologiesIntroduction2016], and our eyes have witnessed a lot more violence since. Formally, a few red pixels sufficed to indicate a character being wounded, whereas today we have hyperreal depictions and glorifications of all kinds of violence.

Jakob Birken recently expanded on the topic of aesthetics, realism and historical reception regarding video game graphics. [@birkenIllusionAlsVersprechen2023]  (Hier ein zwei, drei gute Sätze zu/aus seinem Aufsatz.)

Whereas the inquired wargames have very similar game graphics, the cluster with the barbarian games encompasses a much broader variety of aesthetics. Within this variance, newer is not necessarily "better". From my subjective perspective, the formal elements making up Barbarian "work" better in communicating violence, compared to Torvak or Conan. The latter two tend to skewed perspectives and cartoonishly pumped main characters, which is also a sign of their time. A popular style among Amiga games included bubbly and rounded aesthetics. Barbarian, on the other hand, had to work with limited colours and lower resolution.

The history of depicting violence in video games is also a history of the development of the visual symbol as a signifier of violence to the realistic reproduction of the signified. A handful of red pixels are hardly recognisable as blood, but they indicate such, they carry that meaning. The red pixels are closer to the word than to resembling blood. In this light, the considerations that went into the banning or censoring of these games are especially interesting.
