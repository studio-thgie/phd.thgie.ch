        with Amiga Floppy Disks in Historical Video Game Research</h1>
        <p><img src="assets/IMG_3130.png" /></p>
        <p>Like most humanists and historians, we work with historical
        materials that we compile into a corpus. How does this approach
        apply to researching digital-born media, such as video games
        designed for the Amiga computing system?</p>
        <p>When inquiring older digital games, the question of
        authenticity quickly arises. Playing a game is an integral part
        of investigating it. There is virtually no way to avoid this
        principle. However, when dealing with games designed for
        deprecated or obsolete hardware, you must consider the impact of
        the playing environment on your research. Is it crucial to
        experience the game with the original joystick? Is it acceptable
        to run the game on an emulator, viewing it through a 3.5”
        display? What role did the materiality of the original hardware
        play, including the sounds it produced, in shaping the player’s
        experience?</p>
        <p>Playing a game on an emulator is far more time-efficient.
        Many digital games have already been copied from their physical
        media, such as floppy disks, and archived on informal online
        platforms. It’s a simple matter of matching the appropriate
        emulator software with the downloaded game files, and you’re
        ready to go. Working with the original hardware is considerably
        more resource-intensive. You need to locate the appropriate
        hardware, purchase it (hoping it still functions), transport it,
        and find storage space, not to mention the ongoing
        maintenance.</p>
        <h2 id="amiga">Amiga</h2>
        <p>We recently acquired a complete Amiga set, with a monitor,
        joysticks, and hundreds of floppy disks, primarily containing
        games. More information can be found in this <a
        href="https://hcommons.social/@thgie@post.lurk.org/110899431776662399">Mastodon
        post</a>. The Amiga was an immensely popular home computing
        system in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly for gaming. Among
        the games in this acquisition, two are relevant to our research
        project: an original version of <a
        href="https://swissgames.garden/games/ringside">Ringside</a> (1989)
        and a demo version of <a
        href="https://swissgames.garden/games/rolling-ronny">Rolling
        Ronny</a> (1991). Most of the other games we found in this disk
        collection are available online on the aforementioned informal
        archives and are currently of lesser importance to us.</p>
        <p>Having an Amiga available in our game lab at the University
        of Bern inspired us to play some of the games from our corpus on
        the actual machine. We aren’t necessarily focused on reviving
        questions of authenticity, but it’s undeniably enjoyable to
        explore different playing setups. All we needed were a
        USB-powered floppy drive and some blank floppy disks—or so we
        thought.</p>
        <p>In a brief search for software to read or write Amiga floppy
        disks, we discovered that the challenge lies at the hardware
        level. At that point, we already had a “modern” USB-driven
        floppy drive, which was rendered useless for our purposes.
        Different floppy drive systems employ distinct methods of
        encoding data on the disk, involving varying reading and writing
        patterns. This process is controlled by hardware and cannot be
        altered by software.</p>
        <p>What we required was old hardware capable of connecting to
        new hardware…</p>
        <h2 id="greaseweazle">Greaseweazle</h2>
        <p>Fortunately, we were not the first to confront this issue.
        Several existing projects tackle the problem. Established
        examples that address reading and writing old computing system
        floppies include <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KryoFlux">KryoFlux</a> and <a
        href="https://wernli.pages.in2p3.fr/pauline-doc/en/">Pauline</a>.
        We opted for <a
        href="https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle">Greaseweazle</a>,
        which appeared to be a popular and readily accessible choice
        within the Amiga enthusiast community. Greaseweazle is a compact
        circuit board that connects older floppy drives to modern
        computers running contemporary operating systems via USB. We
        swiftly ordered the device from an online shop specializing in
        spare parts and extensions for the Amiga system.</p>
        <p>Acquiring an older floppy drive proved to be somewhat more
        challenging. Greaseweazle can accommodate numerous different
        drives, from those used in the Commodore 64 and Amiga to those
        found in desktop towers running Windows or a Unix derivative.
        These drives are not ubiquitous on the second-hand market, but
        at least relatively common and affordable, typically priced
        around 10.- CHF. To establish a functional setup, we also needed
        power and data cables, which is when most of the sellers we
        contacted started to ghost us. We didn’t just want the drive; we
        also needed the necessary cables. Many sellers either didn’t
        possess these cables or were unwilling to expend the effort to
        locate them, at least not at the price they were offering the
        drives. Scouring various second-hand stores and cash converters
        yielded no results either.</p>
        <p>Finally, we located a seller in the opposite corner of
        Switzerland who was willing to provide both the drive and the
        cables.</p>

        <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
        <p>Once we assembled all the necessary components, the rest
        proceeded smoothly. Installing the required command-line tools
        for macOS was straightforward, thanks to the well-documented <a
        href="https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle/wiki">Greaseweazle
        Wiki</a>. I would like to delve further into this aspect, but a
        simple <code>gw read filename.adf</code> sufficed to create a
        dump of a diskette that I could later verify in an Amiga
        emulator. Writing a dump I had downloaded from the internet to a
        floppy disk was accomplished with
        <code>gw write filename.adf</code>, and that concluded the
        process. While there are more specific commands and options
        available, I didn’t require them at this point.</p>
        <p>What intrigued me more was the minor ordeal I underwent to
        obtain the appropriate hardware, despite it not being
        excessively old. It began with the realization that a newer
        USB-driven floppy drive wouldn’t suffice and extended to
        visiting every second-hand shop in my area. Floppy disks still
        exist, but there are only a few individuals who truly care about
        this technology, aside from specialized archivists and
        enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>For our research project, this technology is invaluable. We
        rely on it to extract data from floppy disks, preserve them, and
        share them with our fellow researchers. Additionally, it allows
        us to play dumped games on the original hardware. Consequently,
        we need to acquire the necessary knowledge and infrastructure to
        set up and maintain such systems. Maintenance will be a journey
        for another day. For now, I enjoy the ease of use that the
        current setup brings to our research process.</p>
