# Context and code: Approximations of researching older digital games
The first digital games for computing systems and video consoles were developed as early as the 1960s. As objects of research, digital games embody historical perspectives and values, revealing how digital technology proliferated and organised itself. Since the 1980s, a digital game development culture has emerged, resulting in a global industry. Despite their popularity today, the early computer systems and video consoles that ran these games until 2000 have largely become obsolete. Digital games, as a specialised subset of software, share similar problems with their parent source category. They are susceptible to bit rot and media decay, which refers to “the gradual decay of digital information and storage media over time”, rendering information unreadable and digital games nonfunctional. This raises concerns about preservation and the challenges of researching digital games. 

Qualitative approaches driven by the social sciences and humanities are the primary research methods for studying digital games. Drawing from multiple disciplines, video game research often focuses on para- and intertextuality. Recently, digital humanities also have begun conducting inquiries into digital game research using methods borrowed from distant and close reading. Researching older video games can be a challenging task due to their unique nature as historical and digital artefacts. These games cannot be played in their original contexts, which were often defined by contemporary culture and hardware that is now outdated. While emulation can provide some insight into the past, it only offers a limited perspective.

In this contribution, I will explore two approaches that attempt to address these challenges. The HGP method is a historical, source-critical approach to studying video games, which focuses on analysing production, product, and reception. Developed by Eugen Pfister and Arno Görgen, this method aids in reconstructing the original context through production- and reception analysis. In contrast, critical code analysis looks at games from the inside out, assuming that code is not only functional but also a social and semiotic system with its own grammar and meaning. It views code not only as computational instructions, but also as a corpus of text. While this approach allows for reading of context through the artefact, it suffers from source code being a rare good. This perspective allows for the application of both close critical and distant reading methodologies. As video games often rely on para- and intertextuality, these two approaches can complement each other where historical gaps exist. Together, they offer a more comprehensive understanding of digital games as historical artefacts. In this contribution, I will present case studies that showcase the unified application of these two approaches. The games used in this study are taken from the Confederatio Ludens corpus, which focuses on Swiss digital games until the year 2000.
