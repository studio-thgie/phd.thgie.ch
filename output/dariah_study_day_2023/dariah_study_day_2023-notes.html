        Study Day 2023: Call for data pitches</a></p></li>
        <li><p>==we want to learn about your data, what type, what
        particularities, what challenges do you encounter at each step
        of the data life-cycle, what solutions/answers have you found or
        are you still searching for solutions/answers.==</p></li>
        <li><p>3 minutes (3 slides), ~ 400 words</p></li>
        <li><p>I am a PhD student at the University of Bern in digital
        humanities. I am also part of the Sinergia research project
        Confoederatio Ludens, that looks into the early history of video
        game development in Switzerland.</p></li>
        <li><p>The base source material that we work on are video games.
        They are digital-born, multimodal, and often complex objects.
        They have a high technological dependency and need
        interdisciplinary approaches for holistic inquiries.</p></li>
        <li><p>In my dissertation I focus on images taken from within
        video games, screenshots, as well as those games source code. I
        assume a barely acknowledged interplay between the
        techno-historic limits of video game development and the video
        games’ graphics, hence the focus on these two aspects.</p></li>
        <li><p>In my pitch I’d love to focus on my challenges of working
        with source code.</p></li>
        <li><p>Source code needs expertise to be fruitfully analyses
        through hermeneutics. With 20 years of experience in software
        development I feel on the safe side regarding this.</p></li>
        <li><p>Source code can be hard to obtain, especially for old
        video games. Reasons for this problem include bitrot, loss of
        the code base or intellectual property.</p></li>
        <li><p>Source code is essentially text, but what kind of text?
        There are no established distant reading approaches for it.
        Voyant tools or spaCy can help inquiring code comments, but they
        fail miserably when dealing with the actual program code. To
        gain insight through distant reading, new procedures need to be
        developed that can handle highly abstract and modularized texts
        in large corpora.</p></li>
        <li><p>The last challenge I’m dealing with is working
        academically with source code. I have open questions of long
        term archiving, citation practices, data modeling and
        contextualisation. For example, how can I link pieces of code
        with corresponding parts of the executable game?</p></li>
