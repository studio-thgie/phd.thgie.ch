        Study Day 2023: Call for data pitches</a></p></li>
        <li><p>==we want to learn about your data, what type, what
        particularities, what challenges do you encounter at each step
        of the data life-cycle, what solutions/answers have you found or
        are you still searching for solutions/answers.==</p></li>
        <li><p>3 minutes (3 slides), ~ 400 words</p></li>
        <li><p>Hi, I’m Adrian and I am a PhD student at the University
        of Bern in digital humanities. I am also part of the Sinergia
        research project Confoederatio Ludens, that looks into the early
        history of video game development in Switzerland.</p></li>
        <li><p>In our project as well as my own research, video games
        form the base source material that we work on. They are
        digital-born, multimodal, and often complex objects, that have a
        high technological dependency. They also need interdisciplinary
        approaches for holistic inquiries.</p></li>
        <li><p>That given, in my dissertation I focus on images taken
        from within video games, as well as those games source code. In
        my thesis I assume a barely acknowledged interplay between the
        techno-historic limits of digital game development and the video
        games’ graphics, hence the focus on these two aspects.</p></li>
        <li><p>In my pitch I’d love to focus on my challenges of working
        with source code.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Source code needs expertise to fruitfully be analyses
        through hermeneutics. I checked this one because I’m a software
        developer with 20 years of experience.</li>
        <li>Source code can hard to obtain, especially for old video
        games. Reasons for this challenge include of bitrot, loss or
        intellectual property. I also checked this because we tackle
        that in the project I’m part of through the inclusion of the
        original developers into the research process.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>The following two challenges are without resolution
        yet.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Source code is essentially text, but what kind of text?
        There are no established distant reading approaches for it.
        Voyant tools or spaCy can help inquiring code comments, but they
        fail miserably when dealing with the actual program code. To
        gain insight through distant reading, new procedures need to be
        developed that can handle highly abstract and modularized texts
        in large corpora.</li>
        <li>The last challenge I’m dealing with is working academically
        with source code. There are open questions of long term
        archiving, citation practices, data modeling and
        contextualisation, for example, how can I link parts of the
        executable game with corresponding pieces of code.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
