- [DARIAH-CH Study Day 2023: Call for data pitches](https://www.dariah.ch/post/dariah-ch-study-day-2023-call-for-data-pitches)
- ==we want to learn about your data, what type, what particularities, what challenges do you encounter at each step of the data life-cycle, what solutions/answers have you found or are you still searching for solutions/answers.==
- 3 minutes (3 slides), ~ 400 words

- I am a PhD student at the University of Bern in digital humanities. I am also part of the Sinergia research project Confoederatio Ludens, that looks into the early history of video game development in Switzerland.
- The base source material that we work on are video games. They are digital-born, multimodal, and often complex objects. They have a high technological dependency and  need interdisciplinary approaches for holistic inquiries.
- In my dissertation I focus on images taken from within video games, screenshots, as well as those games source code. I assume a barely acknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of video game development and the video games' graphics, hence the focus on these two aspects.
- In my pitch I'd love to focus on my challenges of working with source code.
- Source code needs expertise to be fruitfully analyses through hermeneutics. With 20 years of experience in software development I feel on the safe side regarding this.
- Source code can be hard to obtain, especially for old video games. Reasons for this problem include bitrot, loss of the code base or intellectual property.
- Source code is essentially text, but what kind of text? There are no established distant reading approaches for it. Voyant tools or spaCy can help inquiring code comments, but they fail miserably when dealing with the actual program code. To gain insight through distant reading, new procedures need to be developed that can handle highly abstract and modularized texts in large corpora.
- The last challenge I'm dealing with is working academically with source code. I have open questions of long term archiving, citation practices, data modeling and contextualisation. For example, how can I link pieces of code with corresponding parts of the executable game?
