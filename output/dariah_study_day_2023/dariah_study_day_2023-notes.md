- [DARIAH-CH Study Day 2023: Call for data pitches](https://www.dariah.ch/post/dariah-ch-study-day-2023-call-for-data-pitches)
- ==we want to learn about your data, what type, what particularities, what challenges do you encounter at each step of the data life-cycle, what solutions/answers have you found or are you still searching for solutions/answers.==
- 3 minutes (3 slides), ~ 400 words

- Hi, I'm Adrian and I am a PhD student at the University of Bern in digital humanities. I am also part of the Sinergia research project Confoederatio Ludens, that looks into the early history of video game development in Switzerland.
- In our project as well as my own research, video games form the base source material that we work on. They are digital-born, multimodal, and often complex objects, that have a high technological dependency. They also need interdisciplinary approaches for holistic inquiries.
- That given, in my dissertation I focus on images taken from within video games, as well as those games source code. In my thesis I assume a barely acknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of digital game development and the video games' graphics, hence the focus on these two aspects.
- In my pitch I'd love to focus on my challenges of working with source code.
	- Source code needs expertise to fruitfully be analyses through hermeneutics. I checked this one because I'm a software developer with 20 years of experience.
	- Source code can hard to obtain, especially for old video games. Reasons for this challenge include of bitrot, loss or intellectual property. I also checked this because we tackle that in the project I'm part of through the inclusion of the original developers into the research process.
- The following two challenges are without resolution yet.
	- Source code is essentially text, but what kind of text? There are no established distant reading approaches for it. Voyant tools or spaCy can help inquiring code comments, but they fail miserably when dealing with the actual program code. To gain insight through distant reading, new procedures need to be developed that can handle highly abstract and modularized texts in large corpora.
	- The last challenge I'm dealing with is working academically with source code. There are open questions of long term archiving, citation practices, data modeling and contextualisation, for example, how can I link parts of the executable game with corresponding pieces of code.
