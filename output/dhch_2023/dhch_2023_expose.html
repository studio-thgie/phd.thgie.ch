        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>I studied industrial design at <a
        href="https://www.hypermagazine.ch/">Hyperwerk</a> and acquired
        a MA in design research at <a
        href="https://www.hkb-ma-design.ch/en/home-118.html">MAD HKB</a>
        in 2022. I recently started working on my dissertation in video
        game studies and digital humanities within the research project
        <a
        href="https://www.hkb-idr.ch/projekte/ch-ludens-a-swiss-history-of-digital-games-play-and-game-design-1968-2000">Confederatio
        Ludens</a>. My thesis is framed by the analysis of the image of
        video games and focuses on the interplay between the
        technological basis of the image as well as the arising of
        meaning from its reception.</p>
        <p>My last few working positions involved being a scientific
        software programmer in a research project on participatory image
        archives at the <a
        href="https://dbis.dmi.unibas.ch/research/projects/pia/">University
        of Basel</a> and enjoying a position as junior researcher at the
        <a href="https://www.ixdm.ch">Institute of Experimental Design
        and Media Cultures</a> in a project on <a
        href="https://times-of-waste.ch/en/">electronic waste</a>. I
        have held quite a few shorter and longer positions as frontend,
        full-stack or lead web developer over the last 20 years.</p>
        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p><strong>On code, visuality and meaning: Interdisciplinary
        perspectives on the image in Swiss video games pre-2000</strong>
        <em>(working title)</em></p>
        <p>I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the research on
        the image of the video game and its material base. The image of
        video games brings with its own specificities. The constituted
        image, visible on the screen, is being born from the hardware’s
        calculation. It is interactive and as such holds within itself a
        plurality of different futures, actualizing itself upon the
        player’s input. Research on the image of video games more often
        than not focuses either on the constituted and visible image, or
        it’s material basis – either on visuality or technology.</p>
        <p>Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        video game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole. The methods used in this approach are lent
        from digital humanities, design research and new materialism
        with a focus on technology studies.</p>
