# On code, visuality and meaning: Interdisciplinary perspectives on the image in Swiss video games pre-2000
## About
I studied industrial design at [Hyperwerk](https://www.hypermagazine.ch/) and acquired a MA in design research at [MAD HKB](https://www.hkb-ma-design.ch/en/home-118.html) in 2022. I recently started working on my dissertation in video game studies and digital humanities within the research project [Confederatio Ludens](https://www.hkb-idr.ch/projekte/ch-ludens-a-swiss-history-of-digital-games-play-and-game-design-1968-2000). My thesis is framed by the analysis of the image of video games and focuses on the interplay between the technological basis of the image as well as the arising of meaning from its reception.

My last few working positions involved being a scientific software programmer in a research project on participatory image archives at the [University of Basel](https://dbis.dmi.unibas.ch/research/projects/pia/) and enjoying a position as junior researcher at the [Institute of Experimental Design and Media Cultures](https://www.ixdm.ch) in a project on [electronic waste](https://times-of-waste.ch/en/). I have held quite a few shorter and longer positions as frontend, full-stack or lead web developer over the last 20 years.

## Abstract
**On code, visuality and meaning: Interdisciplinary perspectives on the image in Swiss video games pre-2000** *(working title)*

I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the research on the image of the video game and its material base. The image of video games brings with its own specificities. The constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from the hardware's calculation. It is interactive and as such holds within itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing itself upon the player's input. Research on the image of video games more often than not focuses either on the constituted and visible image, or it's material basis â€“ either on visuality or technology.

Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of video game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole. The methods used in this approach are lent from digital humanities, design research and new materialism with a focus on technology studies.

## Proposals for the Workshop
- Qualitative analysis and linked data generation in image analysis with [Tropy](https://www.tropy.org/)
- Quantitative analysis and evaluation of images through multiple Vision APIs and [Memespector-GUI](https://github.com/jason-chao/memespector-gui)
