        <p>✅ Confoederatio Ludens is a state-funded research project,
        concentrating on the early history of Swiss video game
        development and design between 1968 and 2000. The project is
        constituted through the collaboration of 20 researchers across
        four Universities in Switzerland, bringing together diverse
        research styles and disciplines. Until recently, video game
        studies predominantly focused on the USA and Japan, often
        neglecting the unique histories of smaller regions or the local.
        Confoederatio Ludens seeks to address this gap by delving into
        the rich history of video game design in Switzerland and this
        developments contextuality and relationships to globality.</p>
        <p>Historically, the field of video game studies has
        predominantly fixated on the narratives of the United States and
        Japan, largely overlooking the global panorama of video game
        development. This myopic perspective necessitates a shift
        towards investigating the histories of other regions, fostering
        a more inclusive understanding of the evolution of this dynamic
        medium. Consequently, CH Ludens emerges as a pivotal initiative
        that not only explores the Swiss context but also contributes to
        a more comprehensive and nuanced global history of video
        games.</p>
        <p>The early history of video game development is marked by its
        ephemeral nature, compounded by the aforementioned bias towards
        specific regions. This lack of preservation poses a significant
        challenge in understanding the evolution of this form of
        entertainment. Recognizing the importance of video games as
        cultural artifacts deeply embedded in social, cultural, and
        economic contexts, CH Ludens positions them as valuable
        historical vantage points. By studying video games as cultural
        heritage, the project aims to unveil the socio-political
        configurations from which they emerged, offering insights into
        the broader historical landscape.</p>
        <p>Given the diverse nature of video game studies, CH Ludens
        adopts a multifaceted methodological approach. Three key aspects
        shape its research strategy: oral history, empirical research,
        and media analysis. These methods are applied across a spectrum
        of disciplines, including history, sociology, media theory,
        design research, and digital humanities. The project’s
        interdisciplinary framework underscores the complexity of video
        game studies and highlights the necessity of integrating various
        perspectives to comprehensively explore the multifaceted nature
        of Swiss video game development and design.</p>
        <p>Confoederatio Ludens stands out through its distinctive
        interdisciplinary approach, setting it apart from similar
        research projects. The project’s strength lies in the shared
        foundation of a common corpus, consisting of approximately 150
        video games attributable to Swiss development until the year
        2000. This corpus serves as the starting point for all research
        participants, each contributing to its expansion with their
        unique perspectives and source materials. The collaborative
        nature of this endeavor fosters a rich and multifaceted
        exploration of Swiss video game development.</p>
        <p>The research team comprises members from diverse
        institutions, including the Bern University of the Arts,
        University of Bern, University of Lausanne, and Zurich
        University of the Arts. With six principal investigators, five
        PhD candidates, three postdocs, two associated researchers, and
        three assistants, the team covers a broad spectrum of topics.
        These include the analysis of developer communities, arcades,
        and computer clubs, investigation into design and development
        practices, exploration of material conditions such as
        development tools, media analysis focusing on visual, auditory,
        and interactive elements of video games, scrutiny of reception
        through magazine reviews, and examination of player experiences.
        Lastly, the project delves into the research of electronic and
        computing hardware developed in Switzerland, ensuring a
        comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted landscape of
        Swiss video game development and design. ## Intersection of

        itself. The multifaceted nature of video games, being
        digital-born and encompassing various modalities, demands a
        broad spectrum of analytical lenses, prompting scholars in video
        game studies to draw from a diverse array of methodologies. This
        integrative approach underscores the interdisciplinary nature of
        video game studies, acknowledging the evolving landscape of
        digital entertainment and the need for versatile methodologies
        to comprehend its intricacies.</p>
        <p>Video games, as subjects of study, pose unique challenges due
        to their inherent complexity. Digital-born and multimodal in
        nature, they involve a multitude of agencies, including human,
        social, and technological components. This complexity renders
        video games resistant to holistic capture, prompting researchers
        to adopt nuanced and multifaceted approaches. The intricate
        interplay between these diverse elements within the gaming
        environment calls for a holistic understanding that extends
        beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries, reinforcing the

        <p>Parallelly, the digital humanities, as a research field,
        epitomize dynamism and diversity, characterized by a multitude
        of disciplines and approaches. Often defined by their proximity
        to digital technologies, either as a methodological tool or as a
        study object, digital humanities offer a rich tapestry of
        perspectives and methodologies. The interdisciplinary nature of
        the digital humanities mirrors that of video game studies,
        forming a symbiotic relationship between the two fields. This
        shared dynamism creates an environment where scholars can draw
        inspiration from the expansive toolkit of the digital humanities
        to enrich their understanding of the multifaceted world of video
        games.</p>
        <p>Old video games, situated as study objects, serve as a nexus
        where historical research, video game studies, and the digital
        humanities intersect. Being digital-born entities, these games
        provide a unique lens through which scholars can explore
        historical narratives, video game evolution, and digital
        cultural heritage. The inherent digital nature of old video
        games allows for their investigation through various digital
        approaches, emphasizing the compatibility between historical
        research, video game studies, and the methodologies employed
        within the digital humanities. This convergence further
        amplifies the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to
        comprehensively unravel the historical, cultural, and
        technological dimensions encapsulated within old video
        games.</p>
        <h2 id="digital-humanities-and-ch-ludens">Digital humanities and
        CH Ludens</h2>
        <p>Confoederatio Ludens (CH Ludens) places a significant
        emphasis on three key aspects within the realm of digital
        humanities: the construction, maintenance, and analysis of
        various digital corpora; distant reading of media material; and
        critical analysis of source code. To facilitate these endeavors,
        the project maintains its own dataset hosted on the Swiss Games
        Garden platform and Wikidata, adhering to FAIR/CARE principles.
        The use of linked data and a graph-based structure on Wikidata
        enables machine-assisted research approaches, allowing for the
        visualization of networks of actors, albeit raising questions of
        data modeling. Another vital corpus comprises visual material
        related to digital games from the project’s list, aiming to
        comprehensively represent a game’s aesthetics and content. This
        corpus serves as the foundation for both close and distant
        reading approaches, with Tropy being employed for the analysis
        of some materials. The incorporation of visual material not only
        prompts considerations of data modeling but also requires
        thoughtful curation of image materials.</p>
        <p>In addition to other source materials, CH Ludens endeavors to
        build a corpus with the source code of the researched games, an
        area of particular interest. The project approaches this
        material through critical code analysis, treating code not
        merely as functional instructions for machines but as a text
        subject to hermeneutic and semiotic interpretation within a
        socio-historical context. This approach challenges the notion of
        code as value-neutral, applying theoretical frameworks from
        other semiotic systems and specific interpretive methods
        developed for program discussions. This qualitative approach
        delves into the nuanced layers of meaning embedded in lines of
        code, contributing to a deeper understanding of the
        socio-cultural dimensions of video game development.</p>
        <p>Distant reading emerges as a forte of digital humanities,
        offering a comprehensive overview of digital corpora. Within CH
        Ludens, distant readings prove invaluable in identifying
        patterns, understanding the content present, and revealing
        potential gaps in the dataset. The aspiration is to uncover
        connections and insights that may have eluded traditional close
        readings, enhancing the depth and breadth of the research. The
        intertwining of critical code analysis and distant reading,
        though classically divergent approaches, presents an intriguing
        avenue for exploration within the digital humanities, promising
        nuanced and multifaceted results that contribute to a more
        comprehensive understanding of Swiss video game development and
        design.</p>

        conclusion</h2>
        <p>Digital humanities offers a diverse array of approaches for
        generating knowledge in video game studies, contributing to a
        nuanced understanding of this dynamic field. Concurrently, there
        is a reciprocal relationship where digital humanities can draw
        valuable insights from video game studies, given the novel
        problematics they introduce. Classical methodologies like
        distant reading seamlessly find application in this
        interdisciplinary exchange, offering a bridge between
        traditional humanities approaches and the complex, digital
        nature of video games. The symbiotic relationship between these
        fields underscores the dynamic nature of research methodologies,
        showcasing the adaptability of classical approaches to the
        ever-evolving landscape of digital culture and
        entertainment.</p>
        <p>A focal point of interest within this interdisciplinary
        dialogue is the exploration of source code as a study object, as
        well as the investigation of old hardware—an area relatively
        uncharted in the digital humanities. Both present unique
        challenges, with hardware susceptible to failure and
        necessitating new collaborations with conservation and
        restoration experts to overcome these challenges. Similarly,
        source code analysis is hindered by its limited accessibility
        beyond close readings by individuals possessing the requisite
        skills and knowledge. This highlights the importance of forging
        new methodological pathways within digital humanities to
        overcome these challenges and tap into the wealth of information
        embedded in source code and old hardware.</p>
        <p>As a concluding statement and a call to action, it becomes
        imperative to emphasize the pressing need for research into the
        early history of video game development and design. Despite the
        perception of video games as primarily leisure activities, they
        have evolved into influential cultural artifacts with profound
        societal impacts. Simultaneously complex and influential, video
        games represent a unique form of cultural expression that
        warrants thorough examination. The call to action is underscored
        by the imminent risk of losing the early history of this
        development due to neglect. Preserving and studying this past is
        not just an academic pursuit but a crucial endeavor to
        comprehend the intricate interplay between technology, culture,
        and society in the evolution of this form of entertainment.</p>
