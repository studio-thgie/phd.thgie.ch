        and problem statement</h2>
        <p>Digital games are manifestations of designerly intentions,
        planned execution of a design into a final product. These games
        communicate much more than the intentioned designs. They also
        capture unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and
        ideologies, as well as historical contexts and designerly
        practices. In the following, this is also true for the graphics
        of these video games, on which this proposal is
        concentrating.</p>
        <p>In my thesis, I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the
        research on the image of the digital game and its technological
        base. The image of digital games brings with its own
        specificities. The constituted image, visible on the screen, is
        being born from the hardware’s calculation, which in turn are
        triggered by program code. It is interactive and holds within
        itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing itself upon
        the player’s input. Research on the image of digital games more
        often than not focuses either on the constituted and visible
        image, or its technological origins.</p>
        <p>Following my assumption is the thesis that there is a barely
        acknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        digital game development and the video games’ graphics <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="blankenheimKunstComputerGame2023">(Blankenheim
        2023)</span>, with implications on design practices. Working on
        this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and graphics, halves of
        a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent from
        digital humanities, design research and video game studies and
        assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical
        reading the visuality of digital games. Such an approach opens
        up our research objects to a plethora of interpretations and new
        insights.</p>
        <p>Although the specifics of the digital game’s visuality have
        been anticipated and considered <span class="citation"
        data-cites="flusserUniverseTechnicalImages2011">(Flusser
        2011)</span>, as outlined in 2.1, little research has been
        conducted on the interplay and entanglement of a game’s
        technological structuring through source code and the image seen
        on screen. While the technological foundations of video game
        graphics are naturally not the only important aspect, they play
        a key role. Other aspects will be considered where necessary.
        Technology is means to an end but also entangled into
        socio-politic relations and part of power dynamics and
        interpersonal processes.</p>
        <h2 id="2-current-state-of-research">2. Current state of
        research</h2>
        <h3 id="21-state-of-research">2.1 State of research</h3>
        <p>This dissertation is situated within image studies, while
        also being interested in specific aspects of technology and
        contextualized by video game research. This makes the digital
        humanities as well as design research fitting umbrella
        disciplines, combining critical approaches from the humanities
        with technological inquiries, as well as questioning the
        designers’ involvement and practice.</p>
        <h3 id="22-research-gap">2.2 Research gap</h3>
        <p>When we are interested in an author’s work, we usually study
        her texts, their content, the context of the work, her life, and
        more. Analogously applied to my research, I am interested in the
        author’s writing tools and how these tools relate to the author,
        the writing and the work. The pen and the typewriter can both
        help to write texts. However, both are structurally formative
        for work and texts in their own way. This interplay of
        aesthetics and technology in video game graphics has rarely been
        researched through the aspect of code and programming yet.</p>
        <p>Graphics programming frameworks<a href="/output/expose.html#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> aimed to make programming
        accessible as a design tool. The designers who work with code
        primarily design the code or the resulting programme, which in
        turn generates the graphics <span class="citation"
        data-cites="willumsenSourceCodeFormal2016">(Willumsen
        2016)</span>. Programming is often presented as a purely
        technical act, which has to do with the level of abstraction of
        code as well as the understanding of machines <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020">(Marino 2020)</span>.
        However, the act of programming is far more chaotic, riddled
        with frustration, accompanied by debugging of incomprehensible
        errors, and, most importantly, complexities that elude a single
        human being. The acquisition and virtuoso execution of creative
        coding takes a lot of time and a high tolerance for
        frustration.</p>
        <p>I am interested in this act of translation from one mode
        (code) into another (graphics) as well as the translation as an
        event itself. Early video game graphics development is
        comparable to today’s practices of creative coding or digital
        information graphics. Designers use code to create reactive and
        dynamic systems that are participative and dynamic. There is
        only little research on these two foci, especially seen through
        design research and regarding early video game development.</p>

        questions</em>.</p>
        <h3 id="23-own-research">2.3 Own research</h3>
        <p>Recent case studies have helped me in formulating my research
        focus as well as questions. In the following I want to highlight
        three of these cases: working on video games corpora, analysing
        the visuality of games, and finally critically reading source
        code. All three case studies have been expanded upon in blog
        posts, articles or book contributions.</p>
        <h4 id="231-corpora">2.3.1 Corpora</h4>
        <p>To analyse the diverse digital-born research objects at hand,
        I have to create, maintain and analyse several corpora. More
        information on this dissertations material and the accompanying
        methods are outlined under 4.3.2. I was able to already start
        this process in the case of metadata regarding our list of
        digital games, as well as an image archive.</p>
        <p>The work on metadata involved collaboratively working on a
        digital games list for the German-speaking countries<a
        href="/output/expose.html#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, being involved in the
        maintenance and development of Swiss Games Garden<a href="/output/expose.html#fn3"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, and importing our games’
        metadata into Wikidata<a href="/output/expose.html#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. The work on the
        metadata corpus was oriented towards pragmatically working with
        the data, and as such, is a work in progress. The metadata needs
        further refinements and has to be expanded. This case helped in
        getting an overview of what data is present and in which quality
        it can be acquired.</p>
        <p>A lot of consideration has gone into the image archive<a
        href="/output/expose.html#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. The archive is focused on
        screenshots from our games corpus and some of their paratextual
        material. The considerations on how to structure and create such
        a corpus as well as the practical work on collecting the images
        has helped tremendously to get a basic idea of what image
        material will be available for the analysis through distant
        reading and design rhetoric. Part of the work in the image
        corpus was the development of an ontology to apply in Tropy,
        based on FAVR, which is an important aspect for creating proper
        metadata in the digital humanities.</p>

        alt="DOI" /></a></p>
        <h4 id="232-image-research">2.3.2 Image research</h4>
        <p>I have been able to carry out two case studies regarding
        image research and design rhetoric. The first focused on
        analysing the visuality of a video game, and the second on a
        visual trope in digital games from the 1980ies.</p>
        <p>In the first case study, I had a good look at the images from
        Ball Raider<a href="/output/expose.html#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, a game developed in
        Switzerland and published in 1987. The analysis found its way
        into an upcoming post on the Confoederatio Ludens blog<a
        href="/output/expose.html#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. The close reading of the
        visuality of the game helped form a hypothesis on the game, as
        well as its developers and designers. Part of the analysis was
        an interview with the graphic artist, as well as looking at
        formal and semantic aspects of the images present in the game.
        This case study initiated an inquiry into the visual trope of
        the bare chested barbarian.</p>
        <p>This second inquiry focused on a handful of digital games,
        some of which were not developed in Switzerland, but have been
        formative for the design of later games. The output of this
        analysis<a href="/output/expose.html#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> will find its way into a
        post for the Confoederatio Ludens blog. The study is done in
        collaboration with Aurelia Brandenburg, who is also a
        PhD-student and researcher in the project I am taking part.
        While she is focusing on the games reviews found I video game
        magazines, I investigated why those games barbarian characters
        look like they do, as well as those looks effect on
        meaning-making. I developed a first hypothesis, was able to
        trace the historical development of the visual trope, and made
        first attempts in combining close and distant reading of visual
        material.</p>
        <p>I have collected the material used in this case study in a
        repository.</p>
        <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8315806"><img
        src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8315806.svg"
        alt="DOI" /></a></p>
        <p>Both studies helped in getting a better understanding of
        image research and design rhetoric regarding older video
        games.</p>
        <h4 id="233-critical-code-analysis">2.3.3 Critical Code
        Analysis</h4>
        <p>The last case study was an attempt to critically read the
        source code of an Emulator<a href="/output/expose.html#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, VICE for the
        Commodore 64. The intent for this exploration was twofold –
        figuring out what kind of text source code is and using it as
        the epistemological vantage point to research a project and its
        contextuality. I tried again to combine close and distant
        reading. Hermeneutic distant reading of source code is not an
        established practice, and I considered this approach
        experimental.</p>
        <p>The work on this inquiry helped me get a better view of the
        possibilities and shortcomings of critical code analysis. This
        method is key to my research and is outlined in 4.3. Especially
        experimenting with a distant reading approach was fruitful to
        see what kind of text source code is. The results of this study
        found their way into an upcoming book, published by a working
        group around the AG Spiele of the DHd.</p>
        <p>Scripts and output of this study are collected in their own

        <h3 id="31-objectives">3.1 Objectives</h3>
        <p>This dissertation has the following interrelated research
        objectives.</p>
        <h4
        id="311-historical-design-analysis-of-the-visuality-of-swiss-video-games">3.1.1
        Historical design analysis of the visuality of Swiss video
        games</h4>
        <p>This objective connects the dissertation to the research
        project Confoederatio Ludens and its research goal of analysing
        the history of Swiss video game design and development. The
        focus is laid on the analysis of the image material. The goal is
        to identify flows and novelties, pop-cultural references and
        visual discourse regarding the visuality and how those relate to
        Switzerland as a historic unity. This dissertation adds to the
        interdisciplinary research project by sharing its findings. Part
        of this research objective is the creation of three corpora,
        which I outline and detail under 4.3.2, and their analysis
        through design rhetoric and research on the image.</p>
        <h4
        id="312-bridging-the-analysis-of-visuality-and-technology-in-video-games">3.1.2
        Bridging the analysis of visuality and technology in video
        games</h4>
        <p>As outlined in the introduction, this dissertation attempts
        to bridge the analysis of two different domains, which forms the
        second research objective. Code and visuality are interrelated
        and part of the feedback loop between game, machine and player.
        This objective is distinguished by being researched through a
        methodological approach, the goal being testing and examining
        the possibilities of a joined analysis of the two halves of this
        proposed whole. Details on the joint-methodology of design
        research and critical code analysis can be found under 4.3.</p>
        <p>The main discourse in video game research plays out on a
        spectrum between the game’s narrative, or its ludic qualities.
        Analyses geared either towards games being literature or a
        bundle of play mechanics. Only recently has the approach of
        games as images gained some traction again <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="fizekLudicGlassMaking2022 gerlingScreenImagesInGame2022">(Fizek
        2022; Gerling, Möring, and De Mutiis 2022)</span>. A major
        takeaway from the disciplines’ origin story, the dispute between
        narratology and ludology, was the need for interdisciplinary
        approaches in order for a fuller analysis of digital games.</p>
        <p>Next to furthering the studies on visuality in digital games,
        this research object attempts to bridge inquiries on the images
        seen on screen and the analysis of the images’ underlying
        structures, the code that generates them. The underlying
        thoughts were outlined in the introduction.</p>
        <h4
        id="313-discourse-on-multimodality-of-coding-for-visuality">3.1.3
        Discourse on multimodality of coding for visuality</h4>
        <p>It is hardly possible to see beyond the horizon of
        transformation from code to image. Looking at the visuality, one
        can only make assumptions about the code and vice versa. This
        has a profound impact on designing visuality through code.</p>
        <p>The design theoretician Vilém Flusser worked extensively on
        the way we produce images. He started to differentiate between
        traditionally handmade images and technical images, which were
        produced through technical means, like an apparatus. A key
        aspect of technical images is the continued abstraction between
        designing and the designed. Instead of drawing an image
        manually, where the act of drawing and the result on paper are
        aesthetically intertwined, the designer of an image operates
        technical means, which in turn then produce the image. Flusser’s
        work included digitality, especially digital photography, but
        did not extend to the study of creative coding, or the visual
        design of digital games through programming.</p>
        <p>The third objective wants to research this specific mode of
        visual designing through programming, as well as the
        consequences, impact and effects of this momentum of
        transformation from code to visuality. This means that I will
        tie into Flusser’s theory on the technical image and use that
        vantage point to inquiry this concept in the context of digital
        games visuality.</p>
        <h3 id="32-research-interest">3.2 Research interest</h3>
        <p>My interests focus not only on how technical and visual
        aspects entangle in the image of video games, but also why
        designers pursue such an approach over other media.</p>
        <p>I have followed a programming practice spanning at least two
        decades. My interest got sparked by the realization that the
        things visible on screen are produced by code. Next to being a
        professional software developer, I have extensively inquired
        coding as a creative practice. This vantage point led to a
        career with coding on one side and design studies on the other.
        This path culminates in this dissertation. I want to do research
        on visuality, bringing the analysis of underlying technologies
        and the visible image together. Within that framing, I am
        particularly interested in programming to create images, as a
        designerly act, and how working in one modality (abstract code)
        influences the other modality (the visible image). The image in
        video games has properties that can be found in dynamic data
        visualization or creative coding, and is a fitting study object
        to satisfy my interests.</p>
        <p>My own interests correlate with missing research on the
        topic, and I have outlined more thoughts in 2.3.</p>
        <h3 id="33-research-question">3.3 Research question</h3>
        <p>Being a cumulative dissertation, this project feels more like
        a lesser charted territory that needs to be traversed and mapped
        out, than the definition of a precise question that can, akin to
        a scalpel, dissect research material. I will try nonetheless to
        outline an overall guiding question, with the added disclaimer,
        that it will develop over time and research. More precise
        inquiries will be worked out in the papers that lead up to the
        final thesis.</p>
        <p>To what extent were the technological foundations of early
        video games and their visuality intertwined, influencing and
        shaping practices of graphics design? How do game developers
        leverage programming to shape the visual aesthetics of video
        games, and what implications do this approach hold for the
        intersection of technology and aesthetics in game design?</p>

        and methodology</h2>
        <h3 id="41-research-data">4.1 Research data</h3>
        <p>The research material consists of three corpora – the digital
        games list, and its metadata, the visual material regarding
        those games, and an archive of the source code of the games.
        Whereas I am actively working collaboratively with the research
        team on the former, I am solely responsible for the image
        corpus. From the games list corpus, I will choose a reasonable
        number of exemplary as well as exceptional games that I will
        work on in case studies throughout the different papers needed
        for my dissertation. Exemplary means that some of the games
        stand in for popular genres of the time, while some others can’t
        be put in such a schema. Further information on the corpora is
        outlined in 4.3.2.</p>
        <h3 id="42-cumulative-dissertation">4.2 Cumulative
        dissertation</h3>
        <p>This is a cumulative dissertation. The thesis takes form
        through four papers, which have been accepted for publishing in
        peer-reviewed journals. This means, that not all the outlined
        methods below are applied during the whole of the project, but
        only partially in their respective work packages. The final
        dissertation further needs a synopsis to frame the four papers.
        More information on when which methods are used towards which
        inquiry and output is outlined under 5.2.</p>
        <h3 id="43-methodology">4.3 Methodology</h3>
        <h4 id="431-literature-review">4.3.1 Literature Review</h4>
        <p>Relevant literature has been covered in point 2.1. The
        literature review was key to identifying the research gap
        outlined in point 2.2. Further literature review will be
        conducted towards visuality in video games from a media
        theoretical perspective as well as the notion of text regarding
        program code, as well as upcoming subjects where needed.</p>
        <h4 id="432-corpora-building-and-analysis">4.3.2 Corpora
        building and analysis</h4>
        <p>In this dissertation project, I will help build, maintain and
        analyse three different corpora.</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>A comprehensive list of Swiss digital games until the year
        2000 and their accompanying metadata, such as factual
        information, computing systems, genre, and actors involved in
        the development and distribution</li>
        <li>A catalogue of images containing visual material for the
        games in the first corpus</li>
        <li>An archive of source code from the games in the first
        corpus</li>
        </ol>
        <h5 id="metadata">Metadata</h5>
        <p>The first consists of the digital games that are researched
        in the Confoederatio Ludens project. The project will maintain
        its own dataset, hosted on the Swiss Games Garden platform,
        which consists of a Drupal installation and a custom frontend.
        To uphold FAIR/CARE principles, I will maintain a duplicate
        dataset on Wikidata. Being linked-data and graph-based, Wikidata
        will enable some machine-assisted research approaches, such as
        visualizing networks of actors.</p>
        <h5 id="images">Images</h5>
        <p>The second corpus consists of visual material regarding the
        digital games from the games list. The images will mainly be
        taken directly from the games according to a predefined
        strategy, as well as collected from online archives. The
        strategy is to include as much material as is necessary to fully
        represent a games’ aesthetics and content. Next to formal
        elements, a list of the visual content of a game the Game FAVR
        (see 2.1) model of categorization of the visuality of a digital
        game can help to obtain the right material. Since the focus of
        the dissertation is on the interplay of code and image,
        paratextual material such as box arts or advertisements will
        only be collected for case studies.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>FAVR: Visual modes, ocularizations, framing mechanisms,
        construction of tangible space</li>
        <li>Formal Elements: Colours, textures, shapes, composition and
        layout, typography, etc.</li>
        <li>Semiotic Elements: Characters, objects, levels, interactive
        elements, etc.</li>
        <li>Relevant paratexts: Box art, manuals, advertisement,
        etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More information about the thoughts that went into the
        creation of the image corpus can found on my dissertation wiki
        under <a
        href="https://phd.thgie.ch/notes/Image%20Corpus.html">Image
        Corpus</a> as well as 4.4.2.</p>
        <h5 id="source-code">Source code</h5>
        <p>As mentioned in 1. and 3.1.2, the source code of the
        researched games is of special interest to me. Critical code
        analysis treats code not only as functional instructions to a
        machine, but also as a text that can be hermeneutically
        approached and semiotically read <span class="citation"
        data-cites="marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020">(Marino 2020)</span>.
        Further, from the perspective of design theory, a digital game
        is a second order design <span class="citation"
        data-cites="willumsenSourceCodeFormal2016">(Willumsen
        2016)</span>. The game developers don’t design the game, they
        design the structures that generate the game. Akin to the
        writing aid for an author, like pens or keyboards, source code
        has formal and structural influence on the what and how the game
        developers design. Taken together, these two approaches outline
        source code as a carrier of meaning, as well as the tools and
        material for designing games. This makes source code a core
        focus of my dissertation.</p>
        <p>Working with source code can be difficult. Source code is
        text, but can reach levels of abstraction down to being a string
        of seemingly random alphanumeric strings, in the case of
        Assembler. A certain level of knowledge and experience is needed
        to fruitfully dive into source code with close readings. I have
        made first attempts in critical code analysis, as mentioned
        under 2.3.3. Distant readings, in which the digital humanities
        are especially strong, are yet to be established when
        approaching source code hermeneutically.</p>
        <p>To read source code, one needs to obtain such, which is
        another difficulty. It is yet to be seen, if I will be able to
        acquire the source code of the games we research. Games written
        in Basic, which is not always compiled to machine code, as well
        as magazine listings have their source code directly accessible.
        But, these games only make a small portion of our corpus. In the
        case of games that were compiled, and where the source code is
        not directly accessible, we are dependent on the personal
        archives of the game developers. Decompiling the games is a
        possible approach, but the produced source code is an
        interpretation by the machine and not comparable to the original
        code written by the developers. Further thoughts on this
        problematic can be found in 4.4.1.</p>
        <p>Archiving digital game source code could be done easily, for
        example, by setting up version control repositories. Working
        with source code academically is another problem. Legal issues,
        access rights, long-term archiving, referencing specific pieces
        of code in publications, and other issues arise. This
        dissertation will not be able to tackle all of them, but use the
        source code corpus pragmatically.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>All three corpora are built and maintained with FAIR/CARE
        principles in mind. The metadata in the corpus on Swiss digital
        games will be regularly published as linked open data on
        Wikidata. The catalogue of images will be worked on in Tropy and
        disseminated in an Omeka archive, as well as on Zenodo. The
        archive of source code has no clear long-term path yet, but
        efforts are being made to create sustainable digital games
        archives in Switzerland. Cooperation with these archives is
        desirable.</p>
        <h4 id="433-case-studies">4.3.3 Case studies</h4>
        <p>While the larger corpora can aid in identifying patterns in
        design and production, a set of case studies will help in
        qualitative and in-depth analysis of code and design practices.
        The case studies will be defined during corpora-building, at the
        beginning of the dissertation and will be worked on through the
        proposed interdisciplinary approach including design rhetoric,
        critical code analysis and oral history, as well as creating
        context through the HGP-method and discourse analysis. All of
        these are outlined in the following. The case studies should
        offer data and research material for all of these methods.</p>
        <h4 id="434-horror-game-politics-method">4.3.4 Horror Game
        Politics Method</h4>
        <p>The HGP method is a historical, source-critical approach to
        studying video games, which focuses on analysing production,
        product, and reception. Developed by Eugen Pfister and Arno
        Görgen, this method aids in reconstructing the original context
        through production-, media- and reception analysis.</p>
        <p>Since I will study the visuality as well as the source code
        of digital games mainly from the 1980ies and 1990ies, it is
        important to situate the analysis properly in its historical
        context. The HGP method is building on Roland Barthes approach
        to myth-making, and was applied to reading into the political
        myth of horror games. This aspect of the HGP method will help me
        in the hermeneutic analysis of case studies.</p>
        <h4 id="435-design-rhetoric-bernese-model">4.3.5 Design
        rhetoric, Bernese model</h4>
        <p>Design rhetoric examines the rhetorical principles in
        designed artefacts regarding their intentions and effects.
        Rhetorical design analysis according to the Bernese model
        attempts to bridge the gap between a close study of designed
        objects and the discourse (social, political, psychological)
        that they interact with. This approach then tries to bring
        together intimate expert-knowledge on why things are designed as
        they are and how these designs relate to and shape the world at
        large.</p>
        <p>Design rhetoric is at once interested in the designing, the
        designed, and the effects of both. It as an interdisciplinary
        approach that can profit from interactional expertise, the
        ability to converse expertly in more than one discipline <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="collinsRethinkingExpertise2009">(Collins and Evans
        2009)</span> and bridging formal analysis, hermeneutics and
        collaborative elicitation. There is a tension between the
        intentions of the developers and graphic artists, that are
        deposited into the source code, and the effects created in the
        image on screen. Design rhetoric’s interdisciplinary approach is
        in favour of bringing together these two separate domains and
        will accompany me throughout the dissertation.</p>
        <p>An important aspect of the Bernese model is a focus on formal
        aspects of the designed as well as production processes. This
        favouring of a formal analysis helps in transcending approaches
        which mere state technical effects or capabilities, while not
        reducing the analysis to discourse alone. Design rhetoric after
        the Bernese model aids in capturing technical aspects but also
        reflecting on the influence of a reduced colour palette, i.e.,
        on design practice and the designed, leading up to a discourse
        analysis.</p>
        <h4 id="436-critical-code-analysis">4.3.6 Critical code
        analysis</h4>
        <p>Critical code analysis describes source code for software not
        only as functional instructions for machines, but also as
        cultural artefacts written by humans for humans. This means,
        that source code could potentially be read to acquire knowledge
        about socio-cultural and historical contexts. To what extent
        source code can be treated as a literary text, or leaning more
        on the Foucauldian notion of text, has been tested and described
        in 2.4.4. First preliminary results indicate that source code is
        rich in knowledge, but difficult to access through digital
        humanities distant readings approaches.</p>
        <p>There are many different aspects, or aggregate states, of
        source code that could be analysed. Critical code analysis
        traditionally seems to lean towards code as literature, reading
        it rather literally, and trying to stay as close to the original
        code written than possible. This dissertation is interested in
        source code as the device for designing video game graphics.
        This implies that other aggregates could be of interest, as long
        as the designers’ intentions and practices are still
        legible.</p>
        <p>The initial comparison between and author’s tools to write
        and source code doesn’t hold up completely. Source code is not
        merely the material means of writing. Source code contains
        aspects of the pen, the paper, and the words written on the
        latter. While being a means to an end, writing code to generate
        video game graphics, it is also a documentation about design
        practices and technical affordances, which is the second
        important focus of critical code analysis in this
        dissertation.</p>
        <p>The third and last focus of this method’s application in this
        dissertation is on the relation between code and video game
        graphics as the designed output of a programming design
        practice. This interconnection was outline in 4.3.5 through
        design rhetoric.</p>
        <h4 id="437-discourse-analysis">4.3.7 Discourse Analysis</h4>
        <p>Discourse analysis is a method of analysing language and
        communication use in its social context. It goes beyond
        examining formal aspects to understand how language functions in
        communication and how it shapes and is shaped by social
        structures, power relations, and cultural norms. Discourse
        analysis will be applied in the case studies to draw out from
        formal analysis into the larger dynamics of effects and
        meaning-creation of the researched video games. This is in part
        to root this dissertation in the research project that it is
        part of, as well as to the overarching research inquiry into the
        early history of Swiss video game development.</p>
        <h4 id="438-oral-history">4.3.8 Oral History</h4>
        <p>Oral history is a method of preserving and conveying
        historical information through spoken accounts, personal
        narratives, and first-hand experiences. This approach is part of
        the Confoederatio Ludens project, where we focus on interviews
        with key people in the video game industry of the 1980ies and
        1990ies, including developers, publishers, or people that worked
        on electronics, among others. Unlike written history, which
        relies on written records and documents, oral history captures
        the memories and perspectives of individuals who have witnessed
        or participated in historical events. As such, they can add
        important perspectives and context to the video games that this
        dissertation is inquiring through case studies.</p>
        <h3 id="43-theoretical-position">4.3 Theoretical position</h3>
        <p>The theoretical vantage point of this dissertation will be
        Vilém Flusser’s theory of the technical image. In his thinking,
        he started to differentiate between “traditional” and
        “technical” images <span class="citation"
        data-cites="flusserUniverseTechnicalImages2011">(Flusser
        2011)</span>. The latter do not necessarily represent reality,
        but are constructed and in turn construct reality. The
        “technical” image alienates the viewer from direct experience
        and creates its own world. Flusser’s work can be ascribed to
        critical theory, as he did not only ponder on the subject, but
        also warn of possible problems arising from the rise of the
        “technical” image.</p>
        <p>Flusser’s theoretical approach will be expanded by Marino’s
        theories on code as a cultural artefact <span class="citation"
        data-cites="marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020">(Marino 2020)</span>.
        Critical code analysis is not only a methodological approach but
        also a theoretical perspective, in which code is not only
        textual instruction for machines. Code is also a socio-cultural
        artefact that can be approached through hermeneutics. Code is
        comprehended not just by programmers, but also by lawyers,
        artists, journalists, political activists, and literary
        scholars. Its utility extends beyond mere programming and finds
        application in political discourse, artistic creations, popular
        culture, and the documentation of history.</p>
        <h3 id="44-possible-problems">4.4 Possible problems</h3>
        <p>In the following I will reflect on possible weaknesses in the
        outlined research design as well as how to mitigate the
        risks.</p>
        <h4 id="441-critical-code-analysis">4.4.1 Critical code
        analysis</h4>
        <p>Although researching context is key to this methodology, its
        main focus is source code. In the case of old digital games,
        such source code can be difficult to obtain. Problems can arise,
        for example if the original developers can’t be contacted, don’t
        want to share their code base or don’t have it any more. It is
        certain that some source code can be found, although maybe not
        of the originally targeted games. As a fallback, games from
        beyond the scope of the corpus could be included to find
        material for this approach. Being able to research the interplay
        of technology and visuality in our Swiss digital games corpus
        would be the best possible outcome.</p>
        <p>It is one of these dissertations appeals to open data: To
        study digital games, we need not only their compiled executable
        versions, but also their raw source material, their game code
        <span class="citation"

        <h4 id="442-video-game-image-complexities">4.4.2 Video game
        image complexities</h4>
        <p>Video game images are amongst the most complex images to
        research. In comparison to a still image, video game images add
        the two dimensions of time and interactivity, leading to a large
        amount of possible image material. Studying video game graphics
        can quickly overstrain the available resources, making it
        necessary to reduce complexities and make choices regarding
        corpus saturation. Approaches in digital humanities, such as
        large corpus analysis and distant reading, can help to tackle
        some of these problems. Reducing the number of games analysed is
        applied to create a feasible workload. Finally, some compromises
        have to be made in choosing the image material, which are
        outlined in the considerations regarding the image corpus<a
        href="/output/expose.html#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
        <h4 id="443-image-reception">4.4.3 Image reception</h4>
        <p>As a historical analysis, research into the reception of the
        image, an important aspect of design rhetoric, is limited. This
        shortcoming can be balanced by the Horror-Game-Politics method,
        which is a source-critical approach that builds on research into
        the context.</p>

        <h3 id="61-visuality">6.1 Visuality</h3>
        <p>In using the term visuality, I depend on the definitions
        brought forward by Gillian Rose. Here, visuality refers to the
        socio-cultural construction of how and what we see <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="roseVisualMethodologiesIntroduction2016">(Rose
        2016)</span>. I’m building on these descriptions as I am
        interested in the image as a medium of communication, a semiotic
        device that attempts to transport meaning, and using rhetoric to
        transform intentions into affects. Coming from design rhetoric,
        I am interested in how designers and developers of games encode
        meaning and rhetoric into the images, through the application of
        code. Gillian Rose herself is building upon the work by Hal
        Foster, who defined visuality as the “how we see, how we are
        able, allowed, or made to see, and how we see this seeing and
        the unseeing therein”. This relates the term visuality to the
        slightly more complex scopic regime <span class="citation"
        data-cites="jayScopicRegime2008">(Jay 2008)</span>.</p>
        <h3 id="62-historical-visuality-in-digital-games">6.2
        (Historical) Visuality in digital games</h3>
        <p>As in every other medium, the visuality in digital games has
        its own specifics. Being of high relevancy to this dissertation,
        I’ll outline three of them in the following: ergodicity,
        vocabulary of analysis and techno-historic limits.</p>
        <h4 id="621-ergodicity">6.2.1 Ergodicity</h4>
        <p>Digital games are especially demanding of their consumers, as
        the medium relies on a high level of participation. The
        difference between reading a book, watching a film or playing a
        digital game was especially well captured by Espen Aarseth’s
        application of ergodicity in his book Cybertext. Coming from
        literature studies, Aarseth speaks of a “nontrivial effort
        [that] is required to allow the reader to traverse the text”
        <span class="citation"
        data-cites="aarsethCybertextPerspectivesErgodic1997">(Aarseth
        1997)</span>. This needed effort does not guarantee an
        exhaustive capture of the played game or a successful
        play-through. The player creates a path through the
        configuration of a textual machine, by participating in the
        game.</p>
        <p>This ergodicity is an important aspect when considering the
        image visible on the screen. The image represents one possible
        state, defined by the elements that the designers of the game
        provided, configured by the player’s participation. At the same
        moment, the image on screen communicates choices for the player,
        who then can reconfigure it by acting within the game. The image
        holds its own future possibilities by being within a feedback
        loop between itself and the player. The above outlined process
        is paralleled by the communicative features of the image, which
        can also speak of information relevant to the game’s state, such
        as high scores or player lives, as well as transporting
        narratives that create context and experience for the
        player.</p>
        <h4 id="622-vocabulary-of-analysis">6.2.2 Vocabulary of
        analysis</h4>
        <p>As a rather young discipline, merely coming of age, video
        game studies draws from many other disciplines. This is through
        a lack of an established corpus of methods and approaches form
        within the discipline, as well as many researchers entering the
        field from other disciplines. This is as well true for the
        aspects that concentrating on researching video game
        studies.</p>
        <p>Being intuitively close, a lot of vocabulary and approaches
        to study video game graphics have come from film studies. As
        both media rely on images played out over time, this makes
        somewhat sense. Nonetheless, can the film studies vocabulary
        only capture parts of video game graphics, while not being to
        describe others. Video game graphics are at once aesthetic and
        narrative devices, as well as informative user interfaces. The
        Framework for the Analysis of Visual Representation in Video
        Game (FAVR) <span class="citation"
        data-cites="arsenaultGameFAVRFramework2015">(Arsenault, Côté,
        and Larochelle 2015)</span> attempts to tackle this problem
        specifically and as such is a helpful tool in reflecting how
        video game graphics are analysed.</p>
        <h4 id="623-techno-historic-limits">6.2.3 Techno-historic
        limits</h4>
        <p>The third aspect of relevance is the relationship between the
        image and its technological structures, from which it springs
        forth. Being digital born, the image in digital games depends on
        hardware and software to be seen. These can be considered the
        material aspect of visuality in digital games. Analogue to
        Aarseth’s coining of cybertext, Stefan Möring applies the term
        cyberimage to denote the images’ dependence on its underlying
        technological structures as well as the player’s interaction
        with the machine <span class="citation"
        data-cites="gerlingScreenImagesInGame2022">(Gerling, Möring, and
        De Mutiis 2022)</span>.</p>
        <p>Today’s digital games playing devices are powerful computers,
        and a myriad of software and frameworks aid in the development
        and design. Game design in the early days of game development
        looked quite different. The capabilities of computers were
        fairly limited and the technical realization of the games had to
        be done in early programming languages, such as Basic, Assembly
        dialects or low-level languages like C. These languages do not
        offer the comfort and possibilities of today, and needed more
        abstraction towards the machine. These circumstances form the
        techno-historic limits of early digital game design and directly
        influenced formal and semiotic aspects of those games’
        visuality. These limits as well as the intimate interplay
        between the technological foundation as a semiotic system in
        itself and the visible image will be considered in this
        dissertation through the application of critical code analysis
