        <h2 id="1-introduction-and-problem-statement">1. Introduction
        and problem statement</h2>
        <p>Digital games are manifestations of designerly intentions,
        which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into an
        output. These games communicate much more than the intentioned
        designs. They also capture unspoken and subconscious
        assumptions, bias and ideologies, as well as historical
        contexts. This is equally true for the visuality of the video
        game, on which this proposal is concentrating.</p>
        <p>In my thesis I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the
        research on the image of the digital game and its material base.
        The image of digital games brings with its own specificities.
        The constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from
        the hardware’s calculation. It is interactive and as such holds
        within itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing
        itself upon the player’s input. Research on the image of digital
        games more often than not focuses either on the constituted and
        visible image, or its material basis – either on visuality or
        technology.</p>
        <p>Although the specifics of the digital game’s visuality have
        been anticipated and considered, as outlined in 2.1, no in-depth
        research has been conducted on the interplay and entanglement of
        a games technological structuring through source code and the
        image seen on screen.</p>
        <p>Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        digital game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent
        from digital humanities, design research and video game studies
        and assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical
        reading the visuality of digital games. Such an approach opens
        up our research objects to a plethora of interpretations and new
        insights.</p>
        <h3 id="11-visuality">1.1 Visuality</h3>
        <p>In using the term visuality I depend on the definitions
        brought forward by Gillian Rose. Here, visuality refers to the
        socio-cultural construction of how and what we see <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="roseVisualMethodologiesIntroduction2016">(Rose
        2016)</span>. I’m building on these descriptions as I am mainly
        interested in the image as a medium of communication, a semiotic
        device that attempts to transport meaning, and using rhetorics
        to transform intentions into affects. Coming from design
        rhetorics, I am interested in how designers and developers of
        games encoded meaning and rhetoric into the images, as well as
        the effects of these onto the players. Gillian Rose herself is
        building upon the work by Hal Foster, who defined visuality as
        the “how we see, how we are able, allowed, or made to see, and
        how we see this seeing and the unseeing therein”. This relates
        the term visuality to the slightly more complex scopic regime
        <span class="citation" data-cites="jayScopicRegime2008">(Jay

        <h3 id="12-historical-visuality-in-digital-games">1.2
        (Historical) Visuality in digital games</h3>
        <p>As in every other medium, the visuality in digital games has
        its own specifics. Being of high relevancy to this dissertation,
        I’ll try to outline two of them in the following: ergodicity and
        techno-historic limits.</p>
        <p>Digital games are especially demanding of their consumers as
        the medium relies on a high level of participation. The
        difference between reading a book, watching a film or playing a
        digital game was especially well captured by Espen Aarseth’s
        application of ergodicity in his book Cybertext. Coming from
        literature studies, Aarseth speaks of a “nontrivial effort
        [that] is required to allow the reader to traverse the text”
        <span class="citation"
        data-cites="aarsethCybertextPerspectivesErgodic1997">(Aarseth
        1997)</span>. This needed effort does not guarantee an
        exhaustive capture of the played game or a successful
        play-through. The player creates a path through the
        configuration of a textual machine, by participating in the
        game.</p>
        <p>This ergodicity is an important aspect when considering the
        image visible on the screen. The image represents one possible
        state, defined by the elements that the designers of the game
        provided, configured by the player’s participation. At the same
        moment, the image on screen communicates choices for the player,
        who then can reconfigure it by acting within the game. The image
        holds its own future possibilities by being within a feedback
        loop between itself and the player. The above outlined process
        happens in parallel to the communicative features of the image,
        which can also speak of information relevant to the game’s
        state, such as highscores or player lives, as well as
        transporting narratives that are creating context and experience
        for the player.</p>
        <p>The second aspect of heightened relevance is the relationship
        between the image and its technological structures, from which
        it springs forth. Being digital born, the image in digital games
        is depending on hardware and software in order to be seen. These
        can be considered the material aspect of visuality in digital
        games. Analog to Aarseth’s coining of cybertext, Stefan Möring
        applies the term cyberimage to denote the images dependance on
        its underlying technological structures as well as the player’s
        interaction with the machine <span class="citation"
        data-cites="gerlingScreenImagesInGame2022">(Gerling, Möring, and
        De Mutiis 2022)</span>.</p>
        <p>Todays digital games playing devices are powerful computers
        and myriad of softwares and frameworks aid in the development
        and design. Game design in the early days of game development
        looked quite different. The capabilities of computers were
        fairly limited and the technical realisation of the games had to
        be done in early programming languages, such as Basic or
        Assembler dialects. This circumstances form the techno-historic
        limits of early digital game design and directly influenced
        formal and semiotic aspects of those games’ visuality. These
        limits as well as the intimate interplay between the
        technological foundation as a semiotic system in itself and the
        visible image will be considered in this dissertation through
        the application of critical code analysis <span class="citation"

        <p>This dissertation is situated in the general field of image
        studies, while also being interested in specific aspects of
        technology and contextualised by video game research. This makes
        the digital humanities as well as design research fitting
        umbrella disciplines, combining critical approaches from the
        humanities with technological inquiries, as well as questioning
        the designers involvement and practice. In the following I
        attempt to outline the relevant state of research in the
        respective areas of these fields.</p>

        <p>Based on my assumptions, it is my hypothesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        video game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole.</p>
        <p>Coding for visuality involves multimodal design. The code
        written and the output generated by that code does not correlate
        aesthetically. The brief moment of translation, from one system
        of signifiers into another happens already in the coders mind
        (or knowledge) before the computational act itself. There is a
        double rhetoric at play, one for the code, one for the
        visuality.</p>
        <p>I am essentially interested in the transformation or
        translation of meaning from one system of signifiers into
        another. The materiality of visuality in video games is only on
        the surface comparable to paint in the painting. It is much
        closer to artworks where the artist wrote instructions. The
        basis of the image in video games is of textual nature, and as
        such opens it self to being analysed like a literal text.</p>
        <p>This dissertation proposal extends on Vilèm Flusser’s
        technical image, a theory that states that the development of
        visual technologies drive towards more abstraction and
        alienation in the production of images <span class="citation"
        data-cites="flusserUniverseTechnicalImages2011">(Flusser
        2011)</span>. He included digital images, but did not work on
        visuality that was produced through computer code.</p>

        <p>My recent case studies have helped in formulating my research
        focus as well as the questions I’m interested in. In the
        following I want to highlight three of these cases: working on
        digital games corpora, analysing the visuality of games, and
        critically reading source code.</p>
        <h4 id="231-corpora">2.3.1 Corpora</h4>
        <p>In order to analyse my digital-born research objects, I have
        to create and maintain several corpora. More information on this
        dissertations material is outlined under 4.3.2. I was able to
        already start this process in the case of metadata regarding our
        list of digital games, as well as an image archive.</p>
        <p>The work on metadata involved collaboratively working on a
        digital games list for the German-speaking countries<a
        href="/output/expose.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, being involved in the
        maintenance and development of Swiss Games Garden<a href="/output/expose.html#fn2"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and importing our games
        metadata into Wikidata<a href="/output/expose.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. The work on the
        metadata corpus was oriented towards pragmatically working with
        the data, and as such, is a work in progress. The metadata needs
        further refinements and has to be expanded. This case helped in
        getting an overview of what data is present and in which quality
        it can be aquired.</p>
        <p>A lot of consideration has went into the image archive<a
        href="/output/expose.html#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. The archive is focused on
        screenshots from our games corpus and some of their paratextual
        material. The considerations on how to structure and create such
        a corpus as well as the practical work on collecting the images
        has helped tremendously to get a basic idea of what image
        material will be available for the analysis through distant
        reading and design rhetorics. The methods are outlined under
        4.3.</p>
        <p>Part of the work in the image corpus was the development of
        an ontology to apply in Tropy, based on FAVR.</p>
        <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8158800"><img
        src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8158800.svg"
        alt="DOI" /></a></p>
        <h4 id="232-design-rhetoric">2.3.2 Design Rhetoric</h4>
        <p>I have been able to carry out two case studies regarding
        design rhetorics. The first focused on analysing the visuality
        of a specific game, and the second on a visual trope in digital
        games from the 1980ies.</p>
        <p>In the first case study I had a good look at the images from
        Ball Raider<a href="/output/expose.html#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, a game developed in
        Switzerland and published in 1987. The analysis found its way
        into an upcoming post on the Confoederatio Ludens blog<a
        href="/output/expose.html#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. The close reading of the
        visuality of the game helped form a hypothesis on the game, as
        well as its developers and designers. Part of the analysis was
        an interview with the graphic artist, as well as looking at
        formal and semantic aspects of the images present in the game.
        This case study initiated an inquiry into the visual trope of
        the bare chested barbarian, which emerged in the 80ies.</p>
        <p>This second inquiry focused on a handful of digital games
        that were not development in Switzerland, but have been
        formative for the design of later games. The output of this

        role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> will find its way into a
        post for the Confoederatio Ludens blog. The study is done in
        collaboration with Aurelia Brandenburg, who is also a
        PhD-student and researcher in the project I take part. While she
        is focusing on the games reviews, I’ll try to investigate, why
        those games barbarian characters look like they do, as well as
        that looks effect on meaning-making. I developed a first
        hypothesis, was able to trace the historical development of the
        visual trope and made first attempts in combining close and
        distant reading of visual material.</p>
        <p>I have collected the material used in this case study in a

        <h4 id="233-critical-code-analysis">2.3.3 Critical Code
        Analysis</h4>
        <p>The last case study was an attempt to critically read the
        source code of an Emulator<a href="/output/expose.html#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, VICE for the
        Commodore 64. The intent for this exploration was twofold –
        figuring out what kind of text source code is and using it as
        the epistemological lense to research a project and its
        contextuality. I tried again to combine close and distant
        reading. Hermeneutic distant reading of source code is not an
        established practice, and I considered this approach
        experimental.</p>
        <p>The work on this inquiry helped me get a better view on the
        possibilities and shortcomings of critical code analysis. This
        method is key to my research and is outlined in 4.3. Especially
        experimenting with a distant reading approach was fruitful to
        see what kind of text source code is. The results of this study
        found their way into an upcoming book, published by a working
        group around the AG Spiele of the DHd.</p>

        research questions</h2>
        <h3 id="31-objectives">3.1 Objectives</h3>
        <p>This dissertation has the following interlocking research
        objectives.</p>
        <h4
        id="311-historical-design-analysis-of-the-visuality-of-swiss-video-games">3.1.1
        Historical design analysis of the visuality of Swiss video
        games</h4>
        <p>This objective connects the dissertation to the research
        project Confederatio Ludens and its research goal of analysing
        the history of Swiss video game design and development. The
        focus is laid on the analysis of the image material. The goal is
        to identify flows and novelties, popcultural references and
        visual discourse regarding the visuality and how those relate to
        Switzerland as a historic unity. This dissertation adds to the
        interdisciplinary research project by sharing it’s findings.
        Part of this research objective is the creation of three
        corpora, which I outline and detail under 4.3.2.</p>

        Bridging the analysis of visuality and technology in video
        games</h4>
        <p>This dissertation attempts to bridge the analysis of two
        different domains, which is the second research objective. Code
        and visuality are interrelated and part of the feedback loop of
        gaming machine and player. This objective is distinguished by
        being researched through a methodological approach, the goal
        being testing and examining the possibilities of a joined
        analysis of the two halves of this proposed whole.</p>
        <p>The main discourse in video game research played out on a
        spectrum between the game’s narrative or ludic qualities.
        Analyses geared either towards games being literature or a
        bundle of play mechanics. Only recently has the approach of
        games as images gain some traction again <span class="citation"
        data-cites="fizekLudicGlassMaking2022 gerlingScreenImagesInGame2022">(Fizek
        2022; Gerling, Möring, and De Mutiis 2022)</span>. A major
        takeaway from the disciplines origin story, the dispute between
        narratology and ludology, was the need for interdisciplinary
        approaches in order for a fuller analysis of digital games.</p>
        <p>Next to furthering the studies on visuality in digital games,
        this research object attempts to bridge inquiries on the images
        seen on screen with and analysis of the images’ underlying
        structures, the code that generates them. The underlying
        thoughts were outlined in <em>1. Introduction and problem
        statement</em>.</p>
        <h4
        id="313-discourse-on-multimodality-of-coding-for-visuality">3.1.3
        Discourse on multimodality of coding for visuality</h4>
        <p>It is hardly possible to see beyond the horizon of
        transformation from code to image. Looking at the visuality one
        can only make assumption about the code and vice versa. This has
        a profound impact on designing visuality through code.</p>
        <p>The design theoretician Vilém Flusser thought extensively on
        the way we produce images. He started to differentiate between
        traditionally handmade images and technical images, which where
        produced through technical means, like an apparatus. A key
        aspect of technical images is the abstraction between designing
        and the designed. Instead of drawing an image by hand, where the
        act of drawing and the result on paper are aesthetically
        intertwined, the designer of an image operates technical means,
        that in turn then produce the image. Flusser’s work included
        digitality, especially photography, but did not extend to the
        study of creative coding, or the visual design of digital games
        through programming.</p>
        <p>The third objective wants to research this specific mode of
        visual designing through programming, as well as the
        consequences, impact and effects of this momentum of
        transformation from code to visuality. This means, that will tie
        into Flusser’s theory on the technical image and use that
        vantage point to inquiry this concept in the context of digital
        games visuality.</p>
        <h3 id="32-research-interest">3.2 Research interest</h3>
        <p>My interests focus not only on the how technical and visual
        aspects entangle in the image of video games, but also why
        designers pursue such an approach over other media.</p>
        <p>I have followed a programming practice spanning at least two
        decades. My interest got sparked by the realisation that the
        things visible on screen are produced by code. Next to being a
        professional software developer, I have extensively inquired
        coding as a creative practice. This vantage point led to a
        career with coding on one side and design studies on the other.
        This path culminates in this dissertation. I want to do research
        on visuality, thinking analysing underlying technologies and the
        visible image together. I am particularly interested in
        programming to create images, as a designerly act, and how
        working in one modality (abstract code) influences the other
        modality (the visible image). The image in the game has
        properties that can be found in dynamic data visualisation or
        creative coding and is a fitting study object to satisfy my
        interests.</p>

        accessible as a design tool. The end product of such a practice,
        which are graphics, can be defined as second order design <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="willumsenSourceCodeFormal2016">(Willumsen
        2016)</span>. The designers who work with code primarily design
        this code or the resulting program, which in turn generates the
        graphics. Programming is often presented as a purely technical
        act, which has to do with the level of abstraction of code as
        well as the understanding of machines <span class="citation"
        data-cites="marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020">(Marino 2020)</span>.
        However, the act of programming is far more chaotic, riddled
        with frustration, accompanied by debugging of incomprehensible
        errors, and, most importantly, complexities that elude a single
        human being. The acquisition and virtuos execution of creative
        coding takes years and a high tolerance for frustration.</p>
        <h3 id="33-research-questions">3.3 Research questions</h3>
        <p>To what extend are the technological foundations of video
        games and their visuality entangled? Can they be treated as
        separate domains, or do they have to be read as paratexts to
        each other? Are they on a semiological continuum, or is there a
        shift of expression at the moment of transformation from code to
        image? Can a games code be read meaningful towards the image
        that it emanates?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>How do game developers use programming to create the visual
        design of digital games, and what are the implications of this
        approach for the relationship between technology and aesthetics
        in game design?</li>
        <li>How does the interplay between the technological limits of
        digital game development and the reception of the image
        influence the generation of meaning for players, and what are
        the implications of this interplay for game design?</li>
        <li>In what ways do game designers and developers encode meaning
        and rhetoric into the images of digital games, and how do these
        choices affect players’ emotions and perceptions?</li>
        <li>How has the concept of “visuality” in digital games evolved
        over time, and what are the specific characteristics that
        differentiate it from other forms of visual media?</li>
        <li>What role does ergodicity play in shaping the visuality of
        digital games, and how does it affect players’ engagement with
        the game’s images and narratives?</li>
        <li>How has the technological evolution of digital game
        development tools and hardware influenced the visual design and
        material aspects of digital games, and how have these changes
        impacted the semiotics of game imagery?</li>
        <li>What are the techno-historic limits that early digital game
        design faced, and how did these limits shape the formal and
        semiotic aspects of the visuality of early digital games?</li>
        <li>How can critical code analysis be applied to better
        understand the relationship between the technological foundation
        of digital games and the visible image, and what insights can
        this approach provide into the development of game visuals?</li>

        and methodology</h2>
        <h3 id="41-research-data">4.1 Research data</h3>
        <p>The research base material is built by two corpora – the
        digital games list and it’s metadata, and visual material
        regarding those games. Whereas I am actively working
        collaboratively with the research team on the former, I am
        solely responsible for the latter. From the base material games
        list corpus I will choose a reasonable number of exemplary as
        well as exceptional games. Exemplary means that some of the
        games stand in for popular genres of the time, while some others
        can’t be put in such a schema. Further information on the
        corpora is outline in 4.3.2.</p>
        <h3 id="42-cumulative-dissertation">4.2 Cumulative
        dissertation</h3>
        <p>This is as cumulative dissertation project. The dissertation
        takes its form in four papers, which are accepted for publishing
        in peer-reviewed journals. This means, that not all the outlined
        methods are applied during the whole project, but partially in
        their respective work packages. The final dissertation further
        needs a synopses to frame the four papers. More information on
        when which methods is used towards which inquiry and output is
        outlined under 5.2.</p>
        <h3 id="43-methodology">4.3 Methodology</h3>
        <p>The following outlines the methods I will apply.</p>
        <h4 id="431-literature-review">4.3.1 Literature Review</h4>
        <p>Relevant literature has been covered in point 2.1. The
        literature review was key to identify the research gap outlined
        in point 2.2. Further literature review will be conducted
        towards visuality in video games from a media theoretical
        perspective as well as the notion of text regarding program
        code.</p>
        <h4 id="432-corpora-building-and-analysis">4.3.2 Corpora
        building and analysis</h4>
        <p>In this dissertation project, I will help building and
        maintaining three different corpora.</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>A comprehensive list of Swiss digital games until the year
        2000 and their accompanying metadata, such as factual
        information, computing systems, genre, and actors involved in
        the development and distribution</li>
        <li>A catalog of images containing visual material for the games
        in the first corpus</li>
        <li>An archive of source code from the games in the first
        corpus</li>
        </ol>
        <h5 id="metadata">Metadata</h5>
        <p>The first consists of the digital games that are researched
        in the Confoederatio Ludens project. The project will maintain
        it’s own dataset, hosted on the Swiss Games Garden platform,
        which consists of a Drupal installation and a custom frontend.
        In order to uphold FAIR/CARE principles, I will maintain a
        duplicate dataset on Wikidata. Being linked-data and
        graph-based, Wikidata will enable some machine-assisted research
        approaches, such as visualising networks of actors.</p>
        <h5 id="images">Images</h5>
        <p>The second corpus consists of visual material regarding the
        digital games from the games list. The images will mainly be
        taken directly from the games according to a predefined
        strategy, as well as collected from online archives. The
        strategy is to include as much material as is necessary to fully
        represent a games’ aesthetics and content. Next to formal
        elements, a list of the visual content of a game the Game FAVR
        (see 2.1) model of categorisation of the visuality of a digital
        game can help to obtain the right material. Since the focus of
        the dissertation is on the interplay of code and image,
        paratextual material such as box arts or advertisement will only
        be collected for case studies.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Formal Elements: Color schemes, typography,
        compositions</li>
        <li>Content: Levels, sprites and characters</li>
        <li>FAVR: Visual modes, ocularizations, framing mechanisms,
        construction of tangible space</li>
        <li>Relevant paratexts: Box art, manuals, advertisement,
        etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="source-code">Source code</h5>
        <p>As mentioned in 1. and 3.1.2, the source code of the
        researched games is of special interest to me. Critical code
        analysis treats code not only as functional instructions to a
        machine, but also as a text that can be hermeneutically
        approached and semiotically read <span class="citation"
        data-cites="marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020">(Marino 2020)</span>.
        Further, from the perspective of design theory, a digital game
        is a second order design <span class="citation"
        data-cites="willumsenSourceCodeFormal2016">(Willumsen
        2016)</span>. The game developers don’t design the game, they
        design the structures that generate the game. Akin to the
        writing aid for an author, like pens or keyboards, source code
        has formal and structural influence on the what and how the game
        developers design. Taken together, these two approaches outline
        source code as a carrier of meaning, as well as the tools and
        material for designing games. This makes source code a core
        focus of my dissertation.</p>
        <p>Working with source code can be difficult. Source code is
        text, but can reach levels of abstraction down to being a string
        of seemingly random alpha-numeric strings, in the case of
        Assembler. A certain level of knowledge and experience is needed
        to fruitfully dive into source code with close readings. I have
        made first attempts in critical code analysis, as mentioned
        under 2.3.3. Distant readings, in which the digital humanities
        are especially strong, are yet to be established when
        approaching source code hermeneutically.</p>
        <p>In order to read source code, one needs to obtain such, which
        is another difficulty. It is yet to be seen, if we will be able
        to acquire the source code of the games we research. Games
        written in Basic, which is not compiled to machine code, as well
        as magazine listings have their source code directly accessible.
        But, these games only make a small portion of our corpus. In the
        case of games that were compiled, and where the source code is
        not directly accessible, we are dependent on the personal
        archives of the game developers. Decompiling the games is a
        possible approach, but the produced source code is an
        interpretation by the machine and not comparable to the original
        code written by the developers. Further thoughts on this
        problematic can be found in 4.4.1.</p>
        <p>Archiving digital game source code could be done easily, for
        example by setting up version control repositories. Working with
        source code academically is another problem. Legal issues,
        access rights, longterm archiving, referencing specific pieces
        of code in publications, and other issues arise. This
        dissertation will not be able to tackle all of them, but use the
        source code corpus pragmatically.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>All three corpora are built and maintained with FAIR/CARE
        principles in mind. The metadata in the corpus on Swiss digital
        games will be regularly published as linked open data on
        Wikidata. The catalog of images will be worked on in Tropy and
        disseminated in an Omeka archive, as well as on Zenodo. The
        archive of source code has no clear long-term path yet, but
        efforts are being made to create sustainable digital games
        archives in Switzerland. Cooperation with these archives is
        desirable.</p>
        <h4 id="433-horror-game-politics-method">4.3.3 Horror Game
        Politics Method</h4>
        <p>The HGP method is a historical, source-critical approach to
        studying video games, which focuses on analysing production,
        product, and reception. Developed by Eugen Pfister and Arno
        Görgen, this method aids in reconstructing the original context
        through production- and reception analysis.</p>
        <p>Since I will study the visuality as well as the source code
        of digital games mainly from the 1980ies and 1990ies it is
        important to situate the analysis properly in its historical
        context. The HGP method is building on Roland Barthes approach
        to myth-making, and was applied to reading into the political
        myth of horror games. This aspect of the HGP method will help me
        in the discourse analysis of case studies.</p>
        <h4 id="435-design-rhetoric-bern-model">4.3.5 Design rhetoric
        (Bern model)</h4>
        <p>Design rhetoric examines the rhetorical principles in
        designed artefacts regarding their effects. Rhetorical design
        analysis according to the Bern model attempts to bridge the gap
        between a close study of designed objects and the discourse
        (social, political, psychological) that they interact with. This
        approach then tries to bring together intimate expert-knowledge
        on why things are designed as they are and how these designs
        relate to and shape the world at large.</p>
        <p>Design rhetoric is at once interested in the designing, the
        designed and the effects of both. It as an interdisciplinary
        approach that draws from interactional expertise, the ability to
        converse expertly in more than one discipline <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="collinsRethinkingExpertise2009">(Collins and Evans
        2009)</span> and bridging formal analysis, hermeneutics and
        collaborative elicitation. There is a tension between the
        intentions of the developers and graphic artists, that are
        deposited into the source code, and the affects created in the
        image on screen. Design rhetoric’s interdisciplinary approach is
        in favour of bringing together these two separate domains.</p>
        <h4 id="436-critical-code-analysis">4.3.6 Critical code
        analysis</h4>
        <p>Critical code analysis describes source code for software not
        only as functional instructions for machines, but also as
        cultural artefacts written by humans for humans, akin
        literature. This means, that source code could potentially be
        read in order to acquire knowledge about socio-cultural and
        historical contexts. To what extend source code can be treated
        as a literary text, or leaning more on the Foucauldian notion of
        text, has been tested and described in 2.4.4. First preliminary
        results indicate that source code is rich in knowledge, but
        difficult to access through digital humanities distant readings
        approaches.</p>
        <h3 id="43-theoretical-position">4.3 Theoretical position</h3>
        <p>The theoretical vantage point of this dissertation will be
        Vilém Flusser’s theory of the technical image. In his thinking
        he started to differentiate between “traditional” and
        “technical” images <span class="citation"
        data-cites="flusserUniverseTechnicalImages2011">(Flusser
        2011)</span>. The former are the result of a cultural evolution,
        in which we started to translate direct experience of the world
        into two-dimensional representation of this experience. The
        latter, “technical” images, have been introduced a few steps
        later and are produced through textual descriptions. They do not
        necessarily represent anymore, but are constructed and
        construct. The “technical” image thus alienates the viewer from
        direct experience and creates its own world.</p>
        <p>Flusser was a contemporary media analyst the theoretician who
        inquired new media up to the rise of the computer. Home
        computers, and with them the rise of programming practices
        beyond the university, and video game cultures came after his
        seminal work, and have not been included in the analysis. His
        work can be ascribed to critical theory, as he did not only
        ponder on the subject, but also warn of possible problems
        arising from the rise of the “technical” image.</p>
        <p>Flusser’s theoretical approach will be expanded by Marino’s
        theories on code as a cultural artefact <span class="citation"
        data-cites="marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020">(Marino 2020)</span>.
        Critical code analysis is not only a methodological approach but
        also a theoretical perspective, in which code is not only
        textual instruction for machines. Code is also a socio-cultural
        artefact that can be approached through hermeneutics. Code is
        comprehended not just by programmers, but also by lawyers,
        artists, pundits, journalists, political activists, and literary
        scholars. Its utility extends beyond mere programming and finds
        application in political discourse, artistic creations, popular
        culture, and the documentation of history.</p>
        <h3 id="44-possible-problems">4.4 Possible problems</h3>
        <p>In the following I will reflect on possible weaknesses in
        outlined research design as well as how to mitigate the
        risks.</p>
        <h4 id="441-critical-code-analysis">4.4.1 Critical code
        analysis</h4>
        <p>Although researching context is key to this methodology, it’s
        main focus is source code. In the case of old digital games,
        such source code can be hard to obtain. Problems can arise for
        example if the original developers can’t be contacted, don’t
        want to share their code base or don’t have it anymore. It is
        certain that some source code can be found, although maybe not
        of the originally targeted games. As a fallback, games from
        beyond the scope of the corpus could be enlarged to find
        material for this approach. Being able to research the interplay
        of technology and visuality in our Swiss digital games corpus
        would be the best possible outcome.</p>
        <p>It is one of this dissertations appeals to open data: In
        order to study digital games, we need not only their compiled
        version, but also their raw source material, their game code
        <span class="citation"
        data-cites="konzackComputerGameCriticism2002 willumsenSourceCodeFormal2016">(Konzack
        2002; Willumsen 2016)</span>.</p>
        <h4 id="442-image-reception">4.4.2 Image reception</h4>
        <p>As a historical analysis, research into the reception of the
        image, an important aspect of design rhetoric, is limited. This
        shortcoming can be balanced by the Horror-Game-Politics method,
        which is a source-critical approach that builds on research into
        the context.</p>

        <p>The following timetables are rough estimates and subject to
        change during the course of the research project.</p>
        <h5 id="work-package-0--2023-2024">Work Package 0 –
        2023-2024</h5>
        <p>WP0 is reserved for getting a good overview, set the focus,
        working on the expose, attaining the necessary ECTS points. Part
        of working on the expose are case studies to inquire
        focus-related and methodological questions. The case studies are
        listed under 2.3.</p>
        <h5 id="work-package-1--1-half-2024">Work Package 1 – 1. half
        2024</h5>
        <p>WP1 concentrates on the discipline of digital humanities as
        well as the building, maintaining, and analysing of an image
        corpus regarding the visuality of digital games. The corpus was
        a case study and is outlined in 2.3.1.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Questions: What kind of knowledge can an image corpus on
        digital games generate? What kind of knowledge is lost in the
        process (see ergodicity)? What are the infrastructural
        necessities to enable distant and close readings of the image
        corpus?</li>
        <li>Methods: Image corpus analysis</li>
        <li>Publishing medium: Digital humanities journal, tbd</li>
        <li>Schedule
        <ul>
        <li>1 month: Building corpus</li>
        <li>3 month: Analysing through distant and close reading
        methods</li>
        <li>2 month: Writeup findings, publish and rewrite</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Part of this work package is the start of a digital edition,
        that enables the exploration of the image corpus, as well as
        other data relevant to my dissertation. This edition could stand
        on it’s own, or be structured to fit a specific publication.</p>
        <h5 id="work-package-2--2-half-2024">Work Package 2 – 2. half
        2024</h5>
        <p>WP2 shifts to the HGP-method as well as design rhetorics, see
        4.3.3. I will define three case studies in which I will analyse
        the visuality of one digital game, or a group of games, within
        their historical contexts. The goal is to identify flows and
        novelties, popcultural references and visual discourse regarding
        the visuality and how those relate to Switzerland as a historic
        unity.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Questions: What is the specific visuality of digital games
        made in Switzerland? What kind of influences did it take up,
        propagate, and what kind of elements did it add to the
        discourse?</li>
        <li>Methods: Design rhetorics, HGP-method</li>
        <li>Publishing medium: Video game studies journal, Design
        rhetoric journal tbd</li>
        <li>Schedule
        <ul>
        <li>1 month: Defining case studies</li>
        <li>3 month: One month per case study, analysing the digital
        game(s) through mentioned method and the images collected in
        WP1</li>
        <li>2 month: Writeup findings, publish and rewrite</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="work-package-3--1-half-2025">Work Package 3 – 1. half
        2025</h5>
        <p>WP3 focuses on a corpus which will take time to create, that
        is, the archive holding the source code of the games. The
        collection of, or search for, digital games source code will
        start as early as possible. In most cases this material will be
        found through the original developers, if the source code has
        been preserved at all. Alternative ways to obtain source code
        will be considered as well. For example decompressing the games
        when they were written with Basic, which does not compile. The
        source code archive will be worked through digital humanities
        distant reading approaches, such as corpus analysis, as well as
        close reading attempts and critical code analysis.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Questions: How can we work academically with digital games’
        source code? How does source code behave as corpus and archival
        material? What kind of text is source code and how can digital
        humanities distant reading approach handle it?</li>
        <li>Methods: Critical code analysis</li>
        <li>Publishing medium: Digital humanities journal, tbd</li>
        <li>Schedule:
        <ul>
        <li>2 month: Building of source code archive</li>
        <li>2 month: Distant and close reading analysis of source
        code</li>
        <li>2 month: Writeup findings, publish and rewrite</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="work-package-4--2-half-2025">Work Package 4 – 2. half
        2025</h5>
        <p>WP4 combines work done in the previous work packages and
        attempts to unify several methodological approaches (distant
        reading, close reading, design rhetorics, critical code
        analysis). The aim of this work package is to inquire the
        original hypothesis and questions regarding the invisible rift
        between the research on the image of the digital game and its
        material base, as well as my assumption that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        digital game development and the reception of the image. I will
        define three case studies of digital games of which I have
        material in my image corpus and source code archive, and apply
        said method in combination of methodological results from former
        work packages. To this end, findings from WP2 and WP3 will be
        combined and extended.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Questions: To what extend are the technological foundations
        of video games and their visuality entangled? Can they be
        treated as separate domains, or do they have to be read as
        paratexts to each other? Are they on a semiological continuum,
        or is there a shift of expression at the moment of
        transformation from code to image? Can a games code be read
        meaningful towards the image that it emanates?</li>
        <li>Methods: Critical code analysis, Design rhetorics,
        HGP-method</li>
        <li>Publishing medium: Design rhetoric journal, Video game
        studies journal, tbd</li>
        <li>Schedule:
        <ul>
        <li>1 month: Defining case studies</li>
        <li>3 month: One month per case study, analysing the digital
        game(s) through outlined approach</li>
        <li>2 month: Writeup findings, publish and rewrite</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="work-package-5--2026-2027">Work Package 5 –
        2026-2027</h5>
        <p>WP5 focuses on wrapping up the publishing process and writing
        the dissertation. Next to the accepted papers, I will need to
        add an overarching thread, as well introduction and discussion
        to my dissertation.</p>
