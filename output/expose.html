        <h2 id="introduction-and-problem-statement">1. Introduction and
        problem statement</h2>
        <p>Digital games are manifestations of designerly intentions,
        which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into an
        output. These games communicate much more than the intentioned
        designs. They also capture unspoken and subconscious
        assumptions, bias and ideologies, as well as historical
        contexts. This is equally true for the visuality of the video
        game, on which this proposal is concentrating.</p>
        <p>In my thesis I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the
        research on the image of the digital game and its material base.
        The image of digital games brings with its own specificities.
        The constituted image, visible on the screen, is being born from
        the hardware’s calculation. It is interactive and as such holds
        within itself a plurality of different futures, actualizing
        itself upon the player’s input. Research on the image of digital
        games more often than not focuses either on the constituted and
        visible image, or its material basis – either on visuality or
        technology.</p>
        <p>Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        digital game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole. The methods used in this project are lent
        from digital humanities, design research and video game studies
        and assembled into an interdisciplinary methodology of critical
        reading the visuality of digital games. Such an approach opens
        up our research objects to a plethora of interpretations and new
        insights.</p>
        <h3 id="visuality">1.1 Visuality</h3>
        <p>In using the term visuality I depend on the definitions
        brought forward by Gillian Rose. Here, visuality refers to the
        socio-cultural construction of how and what we see (Rose, 2016).
        I’m building on these descriptions as I am mainly interested in
        the image as a medium of communication, a semiotic device that
        attempts to transport meaning, and using rhetorics to transform
        intentions into affects. Coming from design rhetorics, I am
        interested in how designers and developers of games encoded
        meaning and rhetoric into the images, as well as the effects of
        these onto the players. Gillian Rose herself is building upon
        the work by Hal Foster, who defined visuality as the “how we
        see, how we are able, allowed, or made to see, and how we see
        this seeing and the unseeing therein”. This relates the term
        visuality to the slightly more complex scopic regime (Jay,
        2008).</p>
        <h3 id="historical-visuality-in-digital-games">1.2 (Historical)
        Visuality in digital games</h3>
        <p>As in every other medium, the visuality in digital games has
        its own specifics. Being of high relevancy to this dissertation,
        I’ll try to outline two of them in the following: ergodicity and
        techno-historic limits.</p>
        <p>Digital games are especially demanding of their consumers as
        the medium relies on a high level of participation. The
        difference between reading a book, watching a film or playing a
        digital game was especially well captured by Espen Aarseth’s
        application of ergodicity in his book Cybertext. Coming from
        literature studies, Aarseth speaks of a “nontrivial effort
        [that] is required to allow the reader to traverse the text”
        (Aarseth, 1997). This needed effort does not guarantee an
        exhaustive capture of the played game or a successful
        play-through. The player creates a path through the
        configuration of a textual machine, by participating in the
        game.</p>
        <p>This ergodicity is an important aspect when considering the
        image visible on the screen. The image represents one possible
        state, defined by the elements that the designers of the game
        provided, configured by the player’s participation. At the same
        moment, the image on screen communicates choices for the player,
        who then can reconfigure it by acting within the game. The image
        holds its own future possibilities by being within a feedback
        loop between itself and the player. The above outlined process
        happens in parallel to the communicative features of the image,
        which can also speak of information relevant to the game’s
        state, such as highscores or player lives, as well as
        transporting narratives that are creating context and experience
        for the player.</p>
        <p>The second aspect of heightened relevance is the relationship
        between the image and its technological structures, from which
        it springs forth. Being digital born, the image in digital games
        is depending on hardware and software in order to be seen. These
        can be considered the material aspect of visuality in digital
        games. Analog to Aarseth’s coining of cybertext, Stefan Möring
        applies the term cyberimage to denote the images dependance on
        its underlying technological structures as well as the player’s
        interaction with the machine (Gerling et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>Todays digital games playing devices are powerful computers
        and myriad of softwares and frameworks aid in the development
        and design. Game design in the early days of game development
        looked quite different. The capabilities of computers were
        fairly limited and the technical realisation of the games had to
        be done in early programming languages, such as Basic or
        Assembler dialects. This circumstances form the techno-historic
        limits of early digital game design and directly influenced
        formal and semiotic aspects of those games’ visuality
        (Hutchison, 2008). These limits as well as the intimate
        interplay between the technological foundation as a semiotic
        system in itself and the visible image will be considered in
        this dissertation through the application of critical code
        analysis (Marino, 2020).</p>

        visuality in digital games, and its materiality</h4>
        <p>Based on my assumptions, it is my hypothesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        video game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole.</p>
        <p>Coding for visuality involves multimodal design. The code
        written and the output generated by that code does not correlate
        aesthetically. The brief moment of translation, from one system
        of signifiers into another happens already in the coders mind
        (or knowledge) before the computational act itself. There is a
        double rhetoric at play, one for the code, one for the
        visuality.</p>
        <p>I am essentially interested in the transformation or
        translation of meaning from one system of signifiers into
        another. The materiality of visuality in video games is only on
        the surface comparable to paint in the painting. It is much
        closer to artworks where the artist wrote instructions. The
        basis of the image in video games is of textual nature, and as
        such opens it self to being analysed like a literal text.</p>

        <h3 id="own-research-todo">2.3 Own research #todo</h3>
        <p>My recent case studies have helped in formulating my research
        focus as well as the questions I’m interested in. In the
        following I want to highlight three of these cases: working on
        digital games corpora, analysing the visuality of games, and
        critically reading source code.</p>
        <h4 id="corpora">2.3.1 Corpora</h4>
        <p>In order to analyse my digital-born research objects, I have
        to create and maintain several corpora. More information on this
        dissertations material is outlined under 4.2.2. I was able to
        already start this process in the case of metadata regarding our
        list of digital games, as well as an image archive.</p>
        <p>The work on metadata involved collaboratively working on a
        digital games list for the German-speaking countries<a
        href="/output/expose.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, being involved in the
        maintenance and development of Swiss Games Garden<a href="/output/expose.html#fn2"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and importing our games
        metadata into Wikidata<a href="/output/expose.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. The work on the
        metadata corpus was oriented towards pragmatically working with
        the data, and as such, is a work in progress. The metadata needs
        further refinements and has to be expanded. This case helped in
        getting an overview of what data is present and in which quality
        it can be aquired.</p>
        <p>A lot of consideration has went into the image archive<a
        href="/output/expose.html#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. The archive is focused on
        screenshots from our games corpus and some of their paratextual
        material. The considerations on how to structure and create such
        a corpus as well as the practical work on collecting the images
        has helped tremendously to get a basic idea of what image
        material will be available for the analysis through distant
        reading and design rhetorics. The methods are outlined under
        4.2.</p>
        <p>Part of the work in the image corpus was the development of
        an ontology to apply in Tropy, based on FAVR.</p>

        alt="DOI" /></a></p>
        <h4 id="design-rhetoric">2.3.2 Design Rhetoric</h4>
        <p>I have been able to carry out two case studies regarding
        design rhetorics. The first focused on analysing the visuality
        of a specific game, and the second on a visual trope in digital
        games from the 1980ies.</p>
        <p>In the first case study I had a good look at the images from
        Ball Raider<a href="/output/expose.html#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, a game developed in
        Switzerland and published in 1987. The analysis found its way
        into an upcoming post on the Confoederatio Ludens blog<a
        href="/output/expose.html#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. The close reading of the
        visuality of the game helped form a hypothesis on the game, as
        well as its developers and designers. Part of the analysis was
        an interview with the graphic artist, as well as looking at
        formal and semantic aspects of the images present in the game.
        This case study initiated an inquiry into the visual trope of
        the bare chested barbarian, which emerged in the 80ies.</p>
        <p>This second inquiry focused on a handful of digital games
        that were not development in Switzerland, but have been
        formative for the design of later games. The output of this
        analysis<a href="/output/expose.html#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> will find its way into a
        post for the Confoederatio Ludens blog. The study is done in
        collaboration with Aurelia Brandenburg, who is also a
        PhD-student and researcher in the project I take part. While she
        is focusing on the games reviews, I’ll try to investigate, why
        those games barbarian characters look like they do, as well as
        that looks effect on meaning-making. I developed a first
        hypothesis, was able to trace the historical development of the
        visual trope and made first attempts in combining close and
        distant reading of visual material.</p>
        <p>I have collected the material used in this case study in a
        repository.</p>
        <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8315806"><img
        src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8315806.svg"
        alt="DOI" /></a></p>
        <p>Both studies helped in getting a better understanding of
        design rhetoric.</p>
        <h4 id="critical-code-analysis">2.3.3 Critical Code
        Analysis</h4>
        <p>The last case study was an attempt to critically read the
        source code of an Emulator<a href="/output/expose.html#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, VICE for the
        Commodore 64. The intent for this exploration was twofold –
        figuring out what kind of text source code is and using it as
        the epistemological lense to research a project and its
        contextuality. I tried again to combine close and distant
        reading. Hermeneutic distant reading of source code is not an
        established practice, and I considered this approach
        experimental.</p>
        <p>The work on this inquiry helped me get a better view on the
        possibilities and shortcomings of critical code analysis. This
        method is key to my research and is outlined in 4.2. Especially
        experimenting with a distant reading approach was fruitful to
        see what kind of text source code is. The results of this study
        found their way into an upcoming book, published by a working
        group around the AG Spiele of the DHd.</p>
        <p>Scripts and output of this study are collected in their own
        repository.</p>

        <p>This dissertation has the following interlocking research
        objectives.</p>
        <h4
        id="historical-design-analysis-of-the-visuality-of-swiss-video-games-todo">3.1.1
        Historical design analysis of the visuality of Swiss video games
        #todo</h4>
        <p>This objective connects the dissertation to the research
        project Confederatio Ludens and its research goal of analysing
        the history of Swiss video game design and development. The
        focus is laid on the analysis of the image material. The goal is
        to identify flows and novelties, popcultural references and
        visual discourse regarding the visuality and how those relate to
        Switzerland as a historic unity.</p>
        <p>Part of this research objective is the creation of three
        corpora, which I outline and detail under 4.2.2.</p>
        <h4
        id="bridging-the-analysis-of-visuality-and-technology-in-video-games-todo">3.1.2
        Bridging the analysis of visuality and technology in video games
        #todo</h4>
        <p>Stepping fully into my own dissertation I want to bridge the
        analysis of two different domains. Code and visuality are
        interrelated and part of the feedback loop of gaming machine and
        player. This objective is distinguished by being research
        through a methodological approach, the goal being testing and
        examining the possibilities of a joined analysis of the two
        halves of this proposed whole.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>this needs to be expanded</li>

        Discourse on multimodality of coding for visuality #todo</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>this needs rewritting: focus on the designerly act</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The third objective wants to research the consequences,
        impact and effects of momentum of transformation from code to
        visuality. If code and image are interrelated in terms of
        meaning and discourse, video game developers working on
        technical aspects have to be inquired in terms of their power to
        shape the image discourse. Think of how pixels and glitches
        entered our aesthetic vocabulary. This object is gearing towards
        a media-theoretical approach that expands Vilém Flussers concept
        of the <em>technical image</em> towards video games.</p>
        <p>It is hardly possible to see beyond the horizon of
        transformation from code to image. Looking at the visuality one
        can only make assumption about the code and vice versa. This has
        a profound impact on designing visuality through code.</p>
        <h3 id="research-questions">3.2 Research questions</h3>
        <p>To what extend are the technological foundations of video
        games and their visuality entangled? Can they be treated as
        separate domains, or do they have to be read as paratexts to
        each other? Are they on a semiological continuum, or is there a
        shift of expression at the moment of transformation from code to
        image? Can a games code be read meaningful towards the image
        that it emanates?</p>

        <p>The research base material is built by two corpora – the

        regarding those games. Whereas I am actively working
        collaboratively with the research team on the former, I am
        solely responsible for the latter. From the base material games
        list corpus I will choose a reasonable number of exemplary as
        well as exceptional games. Exemplary means that some of the
        games stand in for popular genres of the time, while some others
        can’t be put in such a schema. Further information on the
        corpora is outline in 4.2.2.</p>
        <h3 id="methodology">4.2 Methodology</h3>
        <p>The following outlines the methods I will apply.</p>
        <h4 id="literature-review">4.2.1 Literature Review</h4>
        <p>Relevant literature has been covered in point 2.1. The
        literature review was key to identify the research gap outlined
        in point 2.2. Further literature review will be conducted
        towards visuality in video games from a media theoretical
        perspective as well as the notion of text regarding program
        code.</p>
        <h4 id="corpora-building-and-analysis">4.2.2 Corpora building
        and analysis</h4>
        <p>In this dissertation project, I will help building and
        maintaining three different corpora.</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>A comprehensive list of Swiss digital games until the year
        2000 and their accompanying metadata, such as factual
        information, computing systems, genre, and actors involved in
        the development and distribution</li>
        <li>A catalog of images containing visual material for the games
        in the first corpus</li>
        <li>An archive of source code from the games in the first
        corpus</li>
        </ol>
        <h5 id="metadata">Metadata</h5>
        <p>The first consists of the digital games that are researched
        in the Confoederatio Ludens project. The project will maintain
        it’s own dataset, hosted on the Swiss Games Garden platform,
        which consists of a Drupal installation and a custom frontend.
        In order to uphold FAIR/CARE principles, I will maintain a
        duplicate dataset on Wikidata. Being linked-data and
        graph-based, Wikidata will enable some machine-assisted research
        approaches, such as visualising networks of actors.</p>
        <h5 id="images">Images</h5>
        <p>The second corpus consists of visual material regarding the
        digital games from the games list. The images will mainly be
        taken directly from the games according to a predefined
        strategy, as well as collected from online archives. The
        strategy is to include as much material as is necessary to fully
        represent a games’ aesthetics and content. Next to formal
        elements, a list of the visual content of a game the Game FAVR
        (see 2.1) model of categorisation of the visuality of a digital
        game can help to obtain the right material. Since the focus of
        the dissertation is on the interplay of code and image,
        paratextual material such as box arts or advertisement will only
        be collected for case studies.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Formal Elements: Color schemes, typography,
        compositions</li>
        <li>Content: Levels, sprites and characters</li>
        <li>FAVR: Visual modes, ocularizations, framing mechanisms,
        construction of tangible space</li>
        <li>Relevant paratexts: Box art, manuals, advertisement,
        etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="source-code">Source code</h5>
        <p>As mentioned in 1. and 3.1.2, the source code of the
        researched games is of special interest to me. Critical code
        analysis treats code not only as functional instructions to a
        machine, but also as a text that can be hermeneutically
        approached and semiotically read (Marino, 2020). Further, from
        the perspective of design theory, a digital game is a second
        order design (Willumsen, 2016). The game developers don’t design
        the game, they design the structures that generate the game.
        Akin to the writing aid for an author, like pens or keyboards,
        source code has formal and structural influence on the what and
        how the game developers design. Taken together, these two
        approaches outline source code as a carrier of meaning, as well
        as the tools and material for designing games. This makes source
        code a core focus of my dissertation.</p>
        <p>Working with source code can be difficult. Source code is
        text, but can reach levels of abstraction down to being a string
        of seemingly random alpha-numeric strings, in the case of
        Assembler. A certain level of knowledge and experience is needed
        to fruitfully dive into source code with close readings. I have
        made first attempts in critical code analysis, as mentioned
        under 2.3.3. Distant readings, in which the digital humanities
        are especially strong, are yet to be established when
        approaching source code hermeneutically.</p>
        <p>In order to read source code, one needs to obtain such, which
        is another difficulty. It is yet to be seen, if we will be able
        to acquire the source code of the games we research. Games
        written in Basic, which is not compiled to machine code, as well
        as magazine listings have their source code directly accessible.
        But, these games only make a small portion of our corpus. In the
        case of games that were compiled, and where the source code is
        not directly accessible, we are dependent on the personal
        archives of the game developers. Decompiling the games is a
        possible approach, but the produced source code is an
        interpretation by the machine and not comparable to the original
        code written by the developers. Further thoughts on this
        problematic can be found in 4.4.1.</p>
        <p>Archiving digital game source code could be done easily, for
        example by setting up version control repositories. Working with
        source code academically is another problem. Legal issues,
        access rights, longterm archiving, referencing specific pieces
        of code in publications, and other issues arise. This
        dissertation will not be able to tackle all of them, but use the
        source code corpus pragmatically.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>All three corpora are built and maintained with FAIR/CARE
        principles in mind. The metadata in the corpus on Swiss digital
        games will be regularly published as linked open data on
        Wikidata. The catalog of images will be worked on in Tropy and
        disseminated in an Omeka archive, as well as on Zenodo. The
        archive of source code has no clear long-term path yet, but
        efforts are being made to create sustainable digital games
        archives in Switzerland. Cooperation with these archives is
        desirable.</p>
        <h4 id="horror-game-politics-method">4.2.3 Horror Game Politics
        Method</h4>
        <p>The HGP method is a historical, source-critical approach to
        studying video games, which focuses on analysing production,
        product, and reception. Developed by Eugen Pfister and Arno
        Görgen, this method aids in reconstructing the original context
        through production- and reception analysis.</p>
        <p>Since I will study the visuality as well as the source code
        of digital games mainly from the 1980ies and 1990ies it is
        important to situate the analysis properly in its historical
        context. The HGP method is building on Roland Barthes approach
        to myth-making, and was applied to reading into the political
        myth of horror games. This aspect of the HGP method will help me
        in the discourse analysis of case studies, outlined in
        4.2.6.</p>
        <h4 id="design-rhetoric-todo">4.2.5 Design rhetoric #todo</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>I feel that design rhetorics is a key methods in bringing
        technology and visuality together. There is a beautiful tension
        between the intentions of the developers and graphic artists,
        that are deposited into the source code, and the affects created
        in the image on screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="critical-code-analysis-1">4.2.6 Critical code
        analysis</h4>
        <p>Critical code analysis describes source code for software not
        only as functional instructions for machines, but also as
        cultural artefacts written by humans for humans, akin
        literature. This means, that source code could potentially be
        read in order to acquire knowledge about socio-cultural and
        historical contexts. To what extend source code can be treated
        as a literary text, or leaning more on the Foucauldian notion of
        text, has been tested and described in 2.4.4. First preliminary
        results indicate that source code is rich in knowledge, but
        difficult to access through digital humanities distant readings
        approaches.</p>
        <h3 id="theoretical-frameworks-todo">4.4 Theoretical frameworks
        #todo</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Design rhetorics</li>
        <li>Cybertext- and image</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="possible-problems">4.4 Possible problems</h3>
        <p>In the following I will reflect on possible weaknesses in
        outlined research design as well as how to mitigate the
        risks.</p>
        <h4 id="critical-code-analysis-2">4.4.1 Critical code
        analysis</h4>
        <p>Although researching context is key to this methodology, it’s
        main focus is source code. In the case of old digital games,
        such source code can be hard to obtain. Problems can arise for
        example if the original developers can’t be contacted, don’t
        want to share their code base or don’t have it anymore. It is
        certain that some source code can be found, although maybe not
        of the originally targeted games. As a fallback, games from
        beyond the scope of the corpus could be enlarged to find
        material for this approach. Being able to research the interplay
        of technology and visuality in our Swiss digital games corpus
        would be the best possible outcome.</p>
        <p>It is one of this dissertations appeals to open data: In
        order to study digital games, we need not only their compiled
        version, but also their raw source material, their game code
        (Konzack, 2002; Willumsen, 2016).</p>
        <h4 id="image-reception">4.4.2 Image reception</h4>
        <p>As a historical analysis, research into the reception of the
        image, an important aspect of design rhetoric, is limited. This
        shortcoming can be balanced by the Horror-Game-Politics method,
        which is a source-critical approach that builds on research into
        the context.</p>
