## Outline
Each sub-item will be expanded into one or two paragraphs.

- Introduction and overview
	- Confoederatio Ludens (CH Ludens) is a research project focusing on the Swiss history of video game development and design from 1968 to 2000. We are 20 researchers at four institutions in Switzerland, encompassing many different research styles and disciplines.
	- Until recently, video games studies concentrated on the USA and Japan, writing only their specific video game history. Hence, the need to inquire about other regions’ histories.
	- The early history of video game development is ephemeral and, taking the former point up again, hasn't been well-preserved. Video games are important cultural artefacts, since they are embedded in social, cultural, economic and further contexts. Used as historical vantage points, they can tell us about the past socio-political configurations that they sprung forth from. As such, they can be identified as cultural heritage.
	- Since video game studies can encompass vastly different disciplines, depending on the research focus, the constellation has to be considered. CH Ludens' methodological approach encompasses three aspects, oral history, empirical research, and media analysis, and includes the disciplines of history, sociology, media theory, design research and, of course, digital humanities.
- Intersection of video game studies and digital humanities
	- Video game studies is a discipline akin to the digital humanities. It is an amalgamation of many research approaches and perspectives. This is at once because of the historic development of the field, but also because there is a need for a diversity of approaches because of the study object.
	- Video games are among the more complex study objects. They are digital-born, multimodal, involve many agencies (human, social, technological), and can’t be holistically captured.
	- Digital humanities is a research field that is equally dynamic and defined through many disciplines and approaches. They are often defined through their proximity to digital technologies, be that as a method or as a study object.
	- Old video games as study objects intersects historical research, video game studies as well as the digital humanities. They are at once digital-born and can be investigated through various digital approaches.
- Digital humanities and CH Ludens
	- There are three aspects in CH Ludens where the digital humanities have the most traction: building, maintaining and analysing different digital corpora, distant reading of media material, and critical analysis of source code.
	- Corpus building, maintaining and analysis
		- The project will maintain its own dataset, hosted on the Swiss Games Garden platform, as well as Wikidata to accommodate FAIR/CARE principles. Being linked-data and graph-based, Wikidata will enable some machine-assisted research approaches, such as visualizing networks of actors. Questions of data modelling arise.
		- Another important corpus consists of visual material regarding the digital games from the games list. The strategy is to include as much material as is necessary to fully represent a games' aesthetics and content. This corpus serves as the basis for close and distant reading approaches. Some of the material will be worked on through Tropy. Again, questions of data modelling arise, but also the need to think about what image material is collected.
		- Next to other source material, we also attempt to build a corpus with source code of the games in question. The source code of the researched games is of special interest to me. This material will be approached through critical code analysis, that treats code not only as functional instructions for a machine, but also as a text that can be hermeneutically approached and semiotically read.
	- Distant reading is where the digital humanities excel. Especially regarding digital corpora, distant readings will aid in getting an overview and seeing what is present, and what is missing. In a best-case scenario, we will also be able to identify patters in our data or find connections we didn't see before.
	- As mentioned, the analysis of source code is done through critical code analysis. This is an approach that applies critical hermeneutics to the interpretation of computer code, program architecture, and documentation within a socio-historical context. It holds that lines of code are not value-neutral and can be analysed using the theoretical approaches applied to other semiotic systems in addition to particular interpretive methods developed particularly for the discussions of programs. This is classically a qualitative approach, and, coming from digital humanities, attempting in distant reading might wield interesting results.
- Discussion and conclusion
	- Digital humanities has a plethora of approaches to offer for generating knowledge in video game studies. On the other hand, the DH can also learn from video game studies, since they pose novel problematics. Classical approaches like distant reading can easily be applied.
	- Of special interest is working with source code as a study object, but also regarding working with old hardware. Neither are an established study object in the digital humanities and both have their challenges. Hardware is prone to failure and new alliances, for example, with conservation and restoration experts, need to be established. Source code, on the other hand, doesn't easily offer investigation beyond close readings by people with the necessary skill and knowledge.
	- As a final statement and call to action, I'd like to point out the need to research the early history of video game development and design as of now. Despite still being considered largely a leisure time activity, video games have grown to have massive cultural influence. At the same time, are they among the more complex cultural artefacts that our societies created. All while we are about to lose the early history of this development through neglect of that past.
