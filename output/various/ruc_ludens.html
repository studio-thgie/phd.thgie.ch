        <li>Introduction and overview
        <ul>
        <li>Confoederatio Ludens (CH Ludens) is a research project
        focusing on the Swiss history of video game development and
        design from 1968 to 2000. We are 20 researchers at four
        institutions in Switzerland, encompassing many different
        research styles and disciplines.</li>
        <li>Until recently, video games studies concentrated on the USA
        and Japan, writing only their specific video game history.
        Hence, the need to inquire about other regions’ histories.</li>
        <li>The early history of video game development is ephemeral
        and, taking the former point up again, hasn’t been
        well-preserved. Video games are important cultural artefacts,
        since they are embedded in social, cultural, economic and
        further contexts. Used as historical vantage points, they can
        tell us about the past socio-political configurations that they
        sprung forth from. As such, they can be identified as cultural
        heritage.</li>
        <li>Since video game studies can encompass vastly different
        disciplines, depending on the research focus, the constellation
        has to be considered. CH Ludens’ methodological approach
        encompasses three aspects, oral history, empirical research, and
        media analysis, and includes the disciplines of history,
        sociology, media theory, design research and, of course, digital
        humanities.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Intersection of video game studies and digital humanities
        <ul>
        <li>Video game studies is a discipline akin to the digital
        humanities. It is an amalgamation of many research approaches
        and perspectives. This is at once because of the historic
        development of the field, but also because there is a need for a
        diversity of approaches because of the study object.</li>
        <li>Video games are among the more complex study objects. They
        are digital-born, multimodal, involve many agencies (human,
        social, technological), and can’t be holistically captured.</li>
        <li>Digital humanities is a research field that is equally
        dynamic and defined through many disciplines and approaches.
        They are often defined through their proximity to digital
        technologies, be that as a method or as a study object.</li>
        <li>Old video games as study objects intersects historical
        research, video game studies as well as the digital humanities.
        They are at once digital-born and can be investigated through
        various digital approaches.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Digital humanities and CH Ludens
        <ul>
        <li>There are three aspects in CH Ludens where the digital
        humanities have the most traction: building, maintaining and
        analysing different digital corpora, distant reading of media
        material, and critical analysis of source code.</li>
        <li>Corpus building, maintaining and analysis
        <ul>
        <li>The project will maintain its own dataset, hosted on the
        Swiss Games Garden platform, as well as Wikidata to accommodate
        FAIR/CARE principles. Being linked-data and graph-based,
        Wikidata will enable some machine-assisted research approaches,
        such as visualizing networks of actors. Questions of data
        modelling arise.</li>
        <li>Another important corpus consists of visual material
        regarding the digital games from the games list. The strategy is
        to include as much material as is necessary to fully represent a
        games’ aesthetics and content. This corpus serves as the basis
        for close and distant reading approaches. Some of the material
        will be worked on through Tropy. Again, questions of data
        modelling arise, but also the need to think about what image
        material is collected.</li>
        <li>Next to other source material, we also attempt to build a
        corpus with source code of the games in question. The source
        code of the researched games is of special interest to me. This
        material will be approached through critical code analysis, that
        treats code not only as functional instructions for a machine,
        but also as a text that can be hermeneutically approached and
        semiotically read.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Distant reading is where the digital humanities excel.
        Especially regarding digital corpora, distant readings will aid
        in getting an overview and seeing what is present, and what is
        missing. In a best-case scenario, we will also be able to
        identify patters in our data or find connections we didn’t see
        before.</li>
        <li>As mentioned, the analysis of source code is done through
        critical code analysis. This is an approach that applies
        critical hermeneutics to the interpretation of computer code,
        program architecture, and documentation within a
        socio-historical context. It holds that lines of code are not
        value-neutral and can be analysed using the theoretical
        approaches applied to other semiotic systems in addition to
        particular interpretive methods developed particularly for the
        discussions of programs. This is classically a qualitative
        approach, and, coming from digital humanities, attempting in
        distant reading might wield interesting results.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Discussion and conclusion
        <ul>
        <li>Digital humanities has a plethora of approaches to offer for
        generating knowledge in video game studies. On the other hand,
        the DH can also learn from video game studies, since they pose
        novel problematics. Classical approaches like distant reading
        can easily be applied.</li>
        <li>Of special interest is working with source code as a study
        object, but also regarding working with old hardware. Neither
        are an established study object in the digital humanities and
        both have their challenges. Hardware is prone to failure and new
        alliances, for example, with conservation and restoration
        experts, need to be established. Source code, on the other hand,
        doesn’t easily offer investigation beyond close readings by
        people with the necessary skill and knowledge.</li>
        <li>As a final statement and call to action, I’d like to point
        out the need to research the early history of video game
        development and design as of now. Despite still being considered
        largely a leisure time activity, video games have grown to have
        massive cultural influence. At the same time, are they among the
        more complex cultural artefacts that our societies created. All
        while we are about to lose the early history of this development
        through neglect of that past.</li>
        </ul></li>
