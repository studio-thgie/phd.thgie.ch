# Source code, visuality, and power structures: A critical reading of video games' code to image transformation
Video games are manifestations of designerly intentions, which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into a product. People of all trades, from code to graphics, thus transform their knowledge and skills into a playable and meaningful experience. But as cultural products, video games communicate much more than these design intentions. They also integrate unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and ideologies.

This is equally true for the visuality of the video game, on which this proposal is concentrating. To analyse this, I will present an approach to a critical and close reading of the transformation of code to images. Drawing on critical code analysis and discourse analysis, I  combine methodologies from design research and the digital humanities. Critical readings serve the purpose of unearthing and dissecting power structures and the generation of meaning in and from our cultural artefacts. Such readings open up our research objects to a plethora of interpretations.

The images in video games differ from paintings or photographs. They are not materially fixed in time-space, but procedurally generated in the moment of play. If we take a closer look at the image of video games and accept it as an artefact that is calculated and constructed by code and computer hardware, we must conclude that the underlying technology is formative for its discourse and meaning. Respectively, that programmers and graphic designers alike are significantly involved in the circulation and formation of meanings and power relations through the image in video games.

Based on these assumptions, it is my hypothesis that there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of video game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves of a proposed whole.

This proposal will present a unifying methodological approach to inquire meaning-making and discourse in the image of video games as well as its underlying code, from which it emanates. As such, code is treated as a meaningful paratext to video games studies and is approached through critical code analysis methods. The proposed framework is tested on the corpus from the Confederatio Ludens research project, which focuses on video games from Switzerland from the 1980ies and 1990ies.

My presentation is structured in three parts. A brief overview of the necessary intellectual concepts will set the theoretical framework for semiology and discourse analysis on the visuality in video games. This is followed by a walkthrough of the methodological approach, outlining the involved steps as well as the tools involved. I will finish by presenting preliminary findings from the analysis of the corpus, as well as a reflection on the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
