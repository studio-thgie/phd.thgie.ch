> It is this question, now, that the conference wishes to tackle how game design practice is influenced and shaped by the theoretical discourse surrounding games (whether in fan forums but specifically in academia) and how game studies and design may create a fruitful interplay between theory and practice.

## Ark
- Emulation is quintessential for video game studies of old games
- At the same time it is also a potentially huge and underdeveloped market, carrying relevance for game development
- Emulation as a partiallity of a larger problem of preservation
	- Auras and Assemblages
- Ever growing field of software and devices that enable a re-enactment of the past
	- Democratization of game play and research
	- Changing the past while making it accessible
		- pixel aesthetics came into being because of techno historic limits. They are still present in emulation despite that today's systems could easily interpolate and enhance graphics. What is the semiology of pixel aesthetics?
- Emulation then becomse semiological infrastructure
	- Case Amiga Emulation (the past that was)
	- Case https://www.emuvr.net/ (that past that is an imagined possibility)
