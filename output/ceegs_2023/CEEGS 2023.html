        <p>It is this question, now, that the conference wishes to
        tackle how game design practice is influenced and shaped by the
        theoretical discourse surrounding games (whether in fan forums
        but specifically in academia) and how game studies and design
        may create a fruitful interplay between theory and practice.</p>
