        code, visuality, and power structures: A critical reading of
        video games’ code to image transformation</h1>
        <p>Video games are manifestations of designerly intentions,
        which is the conscious and planned execution of a design into a
        product. People of all trades, from code to graphics, thus
        transform their knowledge and skills into a playable and
        meaningful experience. But as cultural products, video games
        communicate much more than these design intentions. They also
        integrate unspoken and subconscious assumptions, bias and
        ideologies.</p>
        <p>This is equally true for the visuality of the video game, on
        which this proposal is concentrating. To analyse this, I will
        present an approach to a critical and close reading of the
        transformation of code to images. Drawing on critical code
        analysis and discourse analysis, I combine methodologies from
        design research and the digital humanities. Critical readings
        serve the purpose of unearthing and dissecting power structures
        and the generation of meaning in and from our cultural
        artefacts. Such readings open up our research objects to a
        plethora of interpretations.</p>
        <p>The images in video games differ from paintings or
        photographs. They are not materially fixed in time-space, but
        procedurally generated in the moment of play. If we take a
        closer look at the image of video games and accept it as an
        artefact that is calculated and constructed by code and computer
        hardware, we must conclude that the underlying technology is
        formative for its discourse and meaning. Respectively, that
        programmers and graphic designers alike are significantly
        involved in the circulation and formation of meanings and power
        relations through the image in video games.</p>
        <p>Based on these assumptions, it is my hypothesis that there is
        an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits
        of video game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole.</p>
        <p>This proposal will present a unifying methodological approach
        to inquire meaning-making and discourse in the image of video
        games as well as its underlying code, from which it emanates. As
        such, code is treated as a meaningful paratext to video games
        studies and is approached through critical code analysis
        methods. The proposed framework is tested on the corpus from the
        Confederatio Ludens research project, which focuses on video
        games from Switzerland from the 1980ies and 1990ies.</p>
        <p>My presentation is structured in three parts. A brief
        overview of the necessary intellectual concepts will set the
        theoretical framework for semiology and discourse analysis on
        the visuality in video games. This is followed by a walkthrough
        of the methodological approach, outlining the involved steps as
        well as the tools involved. I will finish by presenting
        preliminary findings from the analysis of the corpus, as well as
        a reflection on the validity and effectiveness of the proposed
        approach.</p>
