----- TEXT: 
This is an overall well written and inspiring abstract. CCA as an analytical approach is generally underserved in theories of literary/narrative gaming, and more work is needed of the kind proposed here. I'm a little puzzled that absolutely no reference is made to existing research in the field, and that no explanation is given of how DH and CCA intersect here. At the very least, I would have expected reference to the seminal work of Mark Marino, Rita Raley and Nick Montfort. The "borderline" rating is thus motivated by a lack of explicit scholarly context that would situated the proposal in existing work, as well as a lack of specificity with regards to the choice of analytical material and the choice of actual analytical tools.

----- TEXT:  
"Source code, visuality, and power structures: A critical reading of video games' code to image transformation" presents an approach to "to a critical and close reading of the transformation of code to images". The suggested method is situated somewhere between design research and digital humanities. The research starts from a hypothesis that "there is an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of video game development and the reception of the image, respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player."  
  
The suggested approach seems like a fruitful combination of analysing the technological base and the resulting images that affect player experience. However, the approach leaves a lot unexplained. For example, the research seems to be based on an unexamined conception of "visuality" and "image". What, exactly, do these terms refer to? There is a variety of alternative answers to this question (ranging from phenomenological explanations of how images are experienced as 3D spaces to approaches drawing from the philosophy of art and fictionality), and those answers have a big effect on how the rest of the research proceeds and what is considered an acceptable answer. Since an answer to this question can partially be the result of this research, the answer doesn't need to be definitive, but having some coherent conception seems necessary to do this research in the first place.  
  
There is also some inaccuracy in the premise of the research:  
  
"The images in video games -- are -- procedurally generated in the moment of play."  
  
This simplifies things quite a bit: some images are, some are not, and some are partially constructed – compare, e.g., Telling Lies, No Man's Sky and Pac-Man and you get different senses of how the "images" are "procedurally generated". The difference between these varieties seems crucial to the suggested research, but isn't commented on in the abstract.  
  
The suggested research also seems to lack awareness of previous research on this topic. Central publications in platform studies, like Racing the Beam (2009), discuss the ways technical limitations/affordances impact the way images are generated, but they go beyond the approach suggested here, taking into account not only the code, but also the material qualities of the machines themselves, for example the amount of visual memory available to the Atari.  
  
Source code analysis as a tool for understanding meaning making processes of the game has also already been done in game studies. See e.g., Willumsen (2016).  
  
The suggested research shows promise, but needs significant theoretical development and awareness of previous research.
