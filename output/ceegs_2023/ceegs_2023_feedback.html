        SCORE: 0 (borderline paper)<br />
        —– TEXT: This is an overall well written and inspiring abstract.
        CCA as an analytical approach is generally underserved in
        theories of literary/narrative gaming, and more work is needed
        of the kind proposed here. I’m a little puzzled that absolutely
        no reference is made to existing research in the field, and that
        no explanation is given of how DH and CCA intersect here. At the
        very least, I would have expected reference to the seminal work
        of Mark Marino, Rita Raley and Nick Montfort. The “borderline”
        rating is thus motivated by a lack of explicit scholarly context
        that would situated the proposal in existing work, as well as a
        lack of specificity with regards to the choice of analytical
        material and the choice of actual analytical tools.</p>
        <p>———————– REVIEW 2 ———————<br />
        SUBMISSION: 14<br />
        TITLE: Source code, visuality, and power structures: A critical
        reading of video games’ code to image transformation<br />
        AUTHORS: Adrian Demleitner</p>
        <p>———– Overall evaluation ———–<br />
        SCORE: -1 (weak reject)<br />
        —– TEXT:<br />
        “Source code, visuality, and power structures: A critical
        reading of video games’ code to image transformation” presents
        an approach to “to a critical and close reading of the
        transformation of code to images”. The suggested method is
        situated somewhere between design research and digital
        humanities. The research starts from a hypothesis that “there is
        an unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits
        of video game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player.”</p>
        <p>The suggested approach seems like a fruitful combination of
        analysing the technological base and the resulting images that
        affect player experience. However, the approach leaves a lot
        unexplained. For example, the research seems to be based on an
        unexamined conception of “visuality” and “image”. What, exactly,
        do these terms refer to? There is a variety of alternative
        answers to this question (ranging from phenomenological
        explanations of how images are experienced as 3D spaces to
        approaches drawing from the philosophy of art and fictionality),
        and those answers have a big effect on how the rest of the
        research proceeds and what is considered an acceptable answer.
        Since an answer to this question can partially be the result of
        this research, the answer doesn’t need to be definitive, but
        having some coherent conception seems necessary to do this
        research in the first place.</p>
        <p>There is also some inaccuracy in the premise of the
        research:</p>
        <p>“The images in video games – are – procedurally generated in
        the moment of play.”</p>
        <p>This simplifies things quite a bit: some images are, some are
        not, and some are partially constructed – compare, e.g., Telling
        Lies, No Man’s Sky and Pac-Man and you get different senses of
        how the “images” are “procedurally generated”. The difference
        between these varieties seems crucial to the suggested research,
        but isn’t commented on in the abstract.</p>
        <p>The suggested research also seems to lack awareness of
        previous research on this topic. Central publications in
        platform studies, like Racing the Beam (2009), discuss the ways
        technical limitations/affordances impact the way images are
        generated, but they go beyond the approach suggested here,
        taking into account not only the code, but also the material
        qualities of the machines themselves, for example the amount of
        visual memory available to the Atari.</p>
        <p>Source code analysis as a tool for understanding meaning
        making processes of the game has also already been done in game
        studies. See e.g., Willumsen (2016).</p>
        <p>The suggested research shows promise, but needs significant
        theoretical development and awareness of previous research.</p>
