## Minarett Attack
- developed by Alexander Segert (Goal AG), 2010
- is broken and can't be played online anymore; it's flash based and i guess after the initial load, the swf tries to get additional assets from a server, that's not online anymore (malformed language.xml, which is returning another domain's html content)
- i did found some video material and it is very well covered by press, because of the people's involvement in right-wing politics and some minor scandals
- brought developer Alexander Segert almost into prison

## DiscriminationPong
- developed by René Bauer, Beat Suter and Mirjam Weder, 2010
- still playable in different version (swf, html, mac/windows); extensively documented
- not extensively covered by press, as far as I can see at the moment (2023-11-22); found some blog posts
- there is an article co-written by René Bauer
- description
	- more or less classic pong. maybe slightly updated graphics. main changes are introduced through rules and game mechanics, whereas the left player is always disadvantaged
