        sign process can be described as follows: while some
        signification systems, such as painted pictures and printed
        books, exist on only one material level (i.e., the level of
        paint and canvas, or of ink and paper), others exist on two or
        more levels, as a book being read aloud (ink-paper and
        voicesoundwaves) or a moving picture being projected (the film
        strip and the image on the silver screen). In these latter
        cases, the relationship between the two levels may be termed
        trivial, as the transformation from one level to the other (what
        we might call the secondary sign production) will always be, if
        not deterministic, then at least dominated by the material
        authority of the first level. In the cybernetic sign
        transformation, however, the relationship might be termed
        arbitrary, because the internal, coded level can only be fully
        experienced by way of the external, expressive level.” (<a

        material level (i.e., the level of paint and canvas, or of ink
        and paper), others exist on two or more levels, as a book being
        read aloud (ink-paper and voicesoundwaves) or a moving picture
        being projected (the film strip and the image on the silver
        screen). In these latter cases, the relationship between the two
        levels may be termed trivial, as the transformation from one
        level to the other (what we might call the secondary sign
        production) will always be, if not deterministic, then at least
        dominated by the material authority of the first level. In the
        cybernetic sign transformation, however, the relationship might
        be termed arbitrary, because the internal, coded level can only
        be fully experienced by way of the external, expressive level.

        impurity, a site of struggle between medium, sign, and operator.
        The fragments produced are. clearly not authored by anyone. They
        are pulverized and reconnected echoes of meaning, and the
        meaning that can be made from them is not the meaning that once
        existed. (p. 64) – By non, or all. Which is to say, that there
        is no hierarchy in agency</p>

        <p>Any text directs its user, by convention, mechanism, or
        social interaction. The reader is (and has always been) a
        necessary part of the text, but one that we now realize can (or
        must) perform more than one function. If these are all texts,
        perhaps the word reader no longer has any clear meaning.

        <p>The important lesson to be learned from discontinuous and
        forking texts is that when two readers approach a text they do
        not have to encounter the same words and sentences in order to
        agree that it probably was the same text. And this is not new:
        it is a classical feature of reading, as Roland Barthes points
        out in his comment on tmesis (1975). (p. 81)</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>For Roland Barthes, tmesis is the reader’s unconstrained
        skipping and skimming of passages, a fragmentation of the linear
        text expression that is totally beyond the author’s control.
        Hypertext re(lding is in fact quite the opposite: as the reader
        explores the labyrinth, she can not afford to tread lightly
        through the text but must scrutinize the links and venues in
        order to avoid meeting the same text fragments over and over
        again (p. 85)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>We might say that hypertext punishes tmesis by controlling
        the text’s fragmentation and pathways and by forcing the reader
        to pay attention to the strategic links. (p. 85)</p>

        <p>Contrary to Nelson’s idealistic claim, the purpose of

        <p>To claim that hypertext is fulfilling “postmodern theory”-and
        that “postmodern theorists have been doing this (i.e.,
        describing hypertext] without knowing it” (24)-is an attempt to
        colonize several rather different critical fields by replacing
        their empirical object or objects on the imperialist pretext
        that they did not really have one until now. (p. 90)</p>

        <p>Afternoon has often been labeled postmodernist, and it does
        contain many literary devices typically associated with
        postmodernism (the metonymic mixing of fragments and genres,
        self-commentary and intrusions by the “author,” typographical
        variation, metaleptic breaks (for a spoof on interactive
        technologies and technologists, see figure 4.1). But in the
        hypertext environment of Afternoon, these devices are
        naturalized and therefore do not cause the subversion they might
        have in a codex format. (p. 93)</p>

        <p>Instead of asking, What have I read? the critic might become

        exploration and technological mastery. (p. 94)</p>

        <p>As one of the programers behind Storyspace, Afternoon’s

        <p>Mary Ann Buckles (1985, 79) argues convincingly that

        popular commercial genre it later gave birth to. (p. 107)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The formula was simple: take a popular fiction genre, for
        example, the detective novel, create a background story (the
        more stereotypical the better, since the players would need less
        initiation), create a map for the player to move around in,
        objects to manipulate, characters to interact with, a plot tree
        or graph with several outcomes, depending on the player’s
        previous decisions, and add descriptions, dialogue, error
        messages, and a vocabulary for the player. This literary
        database is accessed via a subprogram called a parser that
        interprets the player’s input commands (e.g., hit dragon, eat
        sandwich, go north). Once an action has been identified, the
        program changes the database and displays a message about the
        outcome, until the player quits the game, wins, or “dies” and
        must start again. (p. 107)</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>Compared to all other literary formats, including hypertext

        far removed from the genus of hegemonic literature to be
        recognized by any but a few xenophiles, who risk professional
        suspicion or ridicule when they dare suggest the pertinence of
