        <li><p>For all the data algorithms calculate and the resulting
        impact upon people’s social, legal, and financial lives, I tend
        to think of these language objects as quasi-rhetorical agents
        with persuasive abilities. — <a

        <li><p>Although the traditional ways of thinking about computer
        algorithms do not usually include discussions of persuasion, I
        nevertheless maintain algorithms are persuasive because of their
        performative nature and the values and beliefs embedded and
        encoded in their structures. — <a

        <li><p>It is my inkling that persuasion and agency finds its way
        in non-human language objects, i.e., computer code. — <a

        <li><p>One might also conclude that conceptions about algorithms
        run deep in Western values of logic and organization. Within the
        definitional parameters is evidence of how people in Western
        societies think and communicate. There is evidence of a basic
        relationship of problem and solution. There is also evidence of
        the limiting factors of what algorithms can and cannot do, and
        what algorithms perform and “know” about the real and artificial
        of knowledge exchange. — <a

        <li><p>Algorithms in a rhetorical sense, seen from the view of
        the author or team of creators are invented, arranged, styled,
        memorized (in multiple senses), and delivered. Does it
        necessarily follow then that these non-human language objects,
        that influence real change in stock markets, financial data,
        dating sites, and social media spaces, are persuasive in and of
        themselves? Do computer algorithms persuade? — <a

        <li><p>Code that runs on a machine is performative in a much
        stronger sense than that attributed to language. When language
        is said to be performative, the kinds of actions it “performs”
        happen in the minds of humans, as when someone says, “I declare
        this legislative session open” or “I pronounce you husband and
        wife.” Granted, these changes in the mind can and do result in
        behavioral effects, but the performative force of language is
        nonetheless tied to the external changes through complex chains
        of mediation. By contrast, code running in a digital computer
        causes changes in machine behavior and, through networked ports
        and other interfaces, may initiate other changes, all
        implemented in the transmission of code. (49–50) — <a

        <li><p>However, in thinking through the intersubjective
        mediation of humans attaching multiple meanings to a single word
        or word-concept, and only one meaning attached to the
        element</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>, there is still meaning attached to the element/code when
        the machine performs the function, however limited that may be
        in material/computational spaces. — <a

        <li><p>In service to the philosophical and theoretical
        considerations of persuasion, if computer algorithms produce
        their own machinic contexts, which aren’t as highly unique as
        human contexts when associating concepts with words, then
        consideration of the performativity of code—of algorithms—takes
        root. Within the machinic context, the relationship of language
        and force binds in an ephemeral state. By ephemeral, I mean
        giving rise to a context for a written act to occur and with the
        close of the act, the context of the written act concluding,
        with the spatial and temporal elements of the context
        dissipating. Such theoretical ground calls to mind Thomas
        Rickert’s discussions of khôra. In examining the works for
        Kristeva, Derrida, and Ulmer, Ricket notes that
        “chōra transforms our senses of beginning, creation, and
        invention by placing them concretely within material
        environments, informational spaces, and affective (or bodily)
        registers” (252). This view illustrates another way of locating
        code and algorithms within rhetoric’s sphere as a khôraic being
        and non-being of what rhetoric encapsulates. While Rickert notes
        this conversation gives rise to rhetorical invention—for
        Derrida, rhetoric’s place in invention also calls
        attention—albeit briefly—to the spatial and temporal dimensions
        which discourse (and I would add the performativity of computer
        code) resides. — <a

        <li><p>The reciprocal and reflexive nature of algorithms in
        transactional inventions highlights the relationships in the
        network of actants, drawing upon Latour’s actor-network theory.
        The non-human actant computer algorithm performs in the
        interaction of inputs and outputs of data. In some sense,
        Latour’s idea of the “delegation to non-humans” wherein objects
        define how people or other objects move or respond, hints at a
        type of agency. — <a

        <li><p>Interdisciplinary theorist Lucas Introna, who routinely
        publishes on the ethics of technology and surveillance, argues
        that the performativity of computer code should be understood in
        terms of the encoding process from agent—to transmission—to
        receiver, and as such encoded language objects are extensions of
        agency. — <a

        <li><p>Persuasive computer algorithms are written-only language
        objects with encoded agency, transactional invention, and
        embedded values, beliefs, and logics of the three rhetorical
        appeals performing functions that provide the grounds for human
        and non-human change. — <a

        <li><p>First, algorithms can be a systematic way of processing
        and organizing information for persuasive means that logic aids
        in ordering how humans and machines experience the world around
        them. Second, algorithms are decisive in inclusionary and
        exclusionary practices of using or discarding data that does not
        fit the structure of the algorithmic model. In this sense, if an
        algorithm’s structure only allows for data collection from
        websites with over 20 hyperlinks, the websites with less than 20
        links will be excluded from the dataset. Finally, algorithms are
        quasi-objective ideological structures, in that the creation of
        an algorithmic structure relies upon the knowledge and
        experience base of the creator(s), and ideological bias will
        always seep through in the creation of the structure for better
        or for worse. — <a

        <li><p>However, if our colleagues from literature and critical
        theory use the training and tools developed from their home
        disciplines in the field of critical code studies, then why not
        have digital rhetoricians use their social scientific and
        humanities-based theories and methodologies to study, theorize,
        and play with algorithms and code? — <a

        <li><p>What makes a rhetorical code studies different (if at
        all) from a critical code studies? Certainly one variance would
        come from different methodological approaches, with critical
        code studies relying upon hermeneutics and rhetorical code
        studies also offering such an approach along with social science
        methodologies. — <a
