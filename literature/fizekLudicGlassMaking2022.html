        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>Video game analyses have historically focused on the human
        act of play or on the events resulting from the player’s act.
        Until recently, spectating has remained an analytical domain of
        film theory and visual arts. In game studies, this perspective
        has changed, with the arrival of the phenomenon of gameplay
        spectating and game streaming on a mass scale, and its leakage
        into academic as well as popular consciousness. How does the
        spectacle change the analytical perspective towards video games
        as objects of scholarly analysis and video gaming as reflective
        practice? In this paper, I will approach the video game as an
        algorithmic spectacle and propose an analytical perspective to
        study this phenomenon, reaching out to theories of moving
        (digital) image proposed by the philosopher Vilém Flusser and
        the filmmaker Harun Farocki.</p>

        <p><strong>Introduction: Through the Ludic Glass</strong></p>
        <p>Until recently the focus was on the player, whereas
        mass-watching let’s-plays and live-streams brought specating
        into focus.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In my exploration of the spectacle then, I am not that much
        concerned with observing other human players at play, but with
        the question of the configurability and operationality of the
        displayed video game image.</p>

        <li>The image in video games is not made of light, but of

        <li>the author builds on the concept of the technical image by
        Flusser and the operational image by Farocki</li>
        <li>both concepts don’t represent or signify things found in
        reality, but construct their own</li>

        displayed video game image. (p. 2)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I want to portray video games as algorithmic spectacles
        characterized by images that are “…functions in the mathematical
        realm” (Parikka, 2012). In an algorithmic spectacle, light, the
        basic “substance” of optics is replaced by the calculus
        (Parikka, 2012). This foundational transformation of the image
        provokes questions much deeper than those of purely technical
        nature. (p. 2)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Games are programmed systems. Their images displayed
        on-screen are effects of algorithmic operations and at the same
        time, an important part of the game’s operationality. (p. 2)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Often, in order to understand the ludic spectacle, the
        audience needs to know how to interpret the ever-changing visual
        “muddle” (think of fast-paced multiplayer online battle arenas,
        also known as MOBAs). An algorithmic spectacle requires from its
        audience the ability not only to observe images as
        representations of something but above all to decode imaginary
        systems in action. (p. 2)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In order to prepare some ground for the question of
        technicity and operationality of the video game image, I will
        start by providing some rationale behind the choice of the image
        as an analytical category. I will then move on to addressing the
        problem of the representation and computation binary, without
        which the problematic place of the image in the study of video
        games cannot be entirely grasped. (p. 2)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Without rethinking the image, game studies will keep falling
        into the Cartesian trap of differentiation between the visual
        layer – that which is represented – and the rules or mechanics –
        that which is computed (p. 3)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>it is an aesthetic form emerging out of the tension between
        representation and computation; between that which is displayed
        on the screen and that which is computed behind it (p. 4)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Theoretical perspectives looking at video games as digital
        rule-based processes have often pointed towards narrative and
        visuality as merely supporting roles. (p. 5)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>After more than twenty years of research dedicated
        specifically to video games, we no longer need to fear
        “colonization” on the part of other disciplines (Eskelinen
        2001). By now, game studies stand firmly on the
        interdisciplinary ground and can (or even should) reinspect the
        old elephants still marking their presence in the room. I see
        the question of representation/computation as one of the most
        settled proverbial elephants of our field. (p. 5)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>the image abandoned the realm of representation many decades
        ago, together with the synthetization and discretization of
        information. Digital images are no longer representing or
        signifying and hence cannot be placed vis-à-vis game mechanics
        or rulesets. Video games are played and displayed. Their
        operations are often displayed visually and their images are
        operational in nature. The misconception that they still belong
        to representational media rests on the erroneous conflation of
        the image with its sensorial reception on the part of the human
        player/viewer. (p. 5)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The human observer is able to visually judge only the
        continuous aspect, so the discrete essence of the image needs to
        be displayed as if it were no different to the traditional
        analog image. We can find a similar perspective in the work of
        Lev Manovich who analyzes a digital image on the one hand as a
        representation that belongs to human culture and on the other as
        a computer file that belongs to “computer’s own cosmogony”
        (Manovich, 2001, pp. 45-46). (p. 6)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The representation/computation fold consolidates the old
        Cartesian body/mind split disguised under the digital veneer.
        (p. 6)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>What may seem like a paradoxical proposition or a rhetorical
        exercise is rather a materiallygrounded philosophy of media. It
        shows how material processes determine the medial situation or
        how firmly software is grounded in “hard” matter. And this is
        what I would like to point towards in this piece, laying bare
        the video game’s visual and operational layers and bringing them
        back together, for they cannot and should not be seen as
        separate units. (p. 6)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The computational “cut” performed by many of us, game
        scholars, places a default borderline where it does not really
        exist. (p. 6)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I would much rather think in terms of interferences (Dippel
        and Fizek, 2018), tensions and multiplicities (Jayemanne 2017)
        to acknowledge the multi-layered dimension of the video game.
        (p. 6)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The computational nature of technical images questions their
        very ontological position as images in the first place.
        Inaccessible to human senses, they can no longer depict. What we
        are able to see are the visualizations of computational
        processes. As human observers, we must decode technical images
        as continuous representations; otherwise, they would remain
        entirely inaccessible to our aesthetic judgement. In other
        words, “as object of computability, the image must be digital;
        as object of perceptibility, the image must be analogue”
        (p. 7)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Since technical images are no longer representations of the
        outside world but approximations and models of reality, their
        “critical reception … demands a level of consciousness that
        corresponds to the one in which they are produced” (Flusser
        1985/2011, p, 22) (p. 7)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The meaning of a technical image then is literally encoded.
        In order to decode a technical image, as Flusser argues, we do
        not need to read what it shows but rather read how it has been
        programmed (p. 7)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>We must criticize technical images on the basis of their
        program. We must start not from the tip of the vector of meaning
        but from the bow from which the arrow was shot. Criticism of
        technical images requires an analysis of their trajectory and an
        analysis of the intention behind it. And this intention lies in
        the link, the suture of the apparatus that produced them with
        the envisioners wh (p. 7)</p>

        <p>produced them. (Flusser 1985/2011, p. 48) (p. 8)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Operative images “do not represent an object, but rather are
        part of an operation” (Farocki, 2004, p. 17). In other words,
        digital images are no longer approached as representations or
        signs but rather as instruments capable of acting. (p. 8)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>we cannot see the digital. nor can we hear or smell or taste
        or touch it. the digital does not exist for human senses. we
        just cannot perceive it. the computable is the operative and
        dynamic aspect. computability thus is the primary aspect;
        digitality is only secondary. the computable is also called the
        algorithmic. (Nake, 2016, pp. 67-70) (p. 9)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>My own interpretation of operationality does not expand on
        Bogost’s “unit operations.” It is closely tied to the technical
        medium and builds upon Harun Farocki’s perspective, connecting
        operations with computational and algorithmic processes.
        (p. 9)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>To perform a Flusserian interpretation would require a
        systematic analysis of the way, in which the image has been
        constructed. One of the possibilities, as advocated by the
        emerging discipline of critical code studies, would be to
        interpret its underlying code. (p. 12)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Out of Mckeown’s code-analysis we find out that it is not the
        “blacksquare.png” that is the image. Instead, he defines an
        image as an ongoing contextualized process. The operations
        behind the display of as simple an image as a black square
        demonstrate the complexity of the video game spectacle and the
        technical conditions of its meaning production. (p. 12)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>n an attempt to capture the algorithmic spectacle, we could
        also follow Friedrich Kittler’s media archeological method of
        descending from higher to lower levels of observation (Kittler
        1997, p. 150); from that, which is visible on the screen,
        through programs and their infrastructural logic down to the
        operating system, and low-level programming languages including
        the very machine code responsible for the operationality of the
        hardware itself. (p. 13)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Each program comes with certain design possibilities but also
        constraints. In that sense, it becomes an active agent in the
        process of image “envisioning” as theorized by Flusser.
        (p. 13)</p>
