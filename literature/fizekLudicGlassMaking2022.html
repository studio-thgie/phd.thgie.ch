        <p>Video game analyses have historically focused on the human
        act of play or on the events resulting from the player’s act.
        Until recently, spectating has remained an analytical domain of
        film theory and visual arts. In game studies, this perspective
        has changed, with the arrival of the phenomenon of gameplay
        spectating and game streaming on a mass scale, and its leakage
        into academic as well as popular consciousness. How does the
        spectacle change the analytical perspective towards video games
        as objects of scholarly analysis and video gaming as reflective
        practice? In this paper, I will approach the video game as an
        algorithmic spectacle and propose an analytical perspective to
        study this phenomenon, reaching out to theories of moving
        (digital) image proposed by the philosopher Vilém Flusser and
        the filmmaker Harun Farocki.</p>
