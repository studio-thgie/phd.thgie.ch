- For all the data algorithms calculate and the resulting impact upon people’s social, legal, and financial lives, I tend to think of these language objects as quasi-rhetorical agents with persuasive abilities. — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:11:33](https://hyp.is/40HvrvO4Ee2bcC9uruM-7g/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- Although the traditional ways of thinking about computer algorithms do not usually include discussions of persuasion, I nevertheless maintain algorithms are persuasive because of their performative nature and the values and beliefs embedded and encoded in their structures. — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:12:06](https://hyp.is/9zhobPO4Ee2coOs2O52fDA/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- It is my inkling that persuasion and agency finds its way in non-human language objects, i.e., computer code. — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:28:16](https://hyp.is/OTFjevO7Ee2pYc9GNkxdGQ/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- one might conclude algorithms as agnostic language objects — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:32:09](https://hyp.is/xBwbsPO7Ee2u39MtnMJqQQ/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- One might also conclude that conceptions about algorithms run deep in Western values of logic and organization. Within the definitional parameters is evidence of how people in Western societies think and communicate. There is evidence of a basic relationship of problem and solution. There is also evidence of the limiting factors of what algorithms can and cannot do, and what algorithms perform and “know” about the real and artificial of knowledge exchange. — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:32:53](https://hyp.is/3mZuEvO7Ee2Z119kyIjHgQ/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- Algorithms in a rhetorical sense, seen from the view of the author or team of creators are invented, arranged, styled, memorized (in multiple senses), and delivered. Does it necessarily follow then that these non-human language objects, that influence real change in stock markets, financial data, dating sites, and social media spaces, are persuasive in and of themselves? Do computer algorithms persuade? — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:35:22](https://hyp.is/NxWymPO8Ee2u4atQCUPcdg/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- Code that runs on a machine is performative in a much stronger sense than that attributed to language. When language is said to be performative, the kinds of actions it “performs” happen in the minds of humans, as when someone says, “I declare this legislative session open” or “I pronounce you husband and wife.” Granted, these changes in the mind can and do result in behavioral effects, but the performative force of language is nonetheless tied to the external changes through complex chains of mediation. By contrast, code running in a digital computer causes changes in machine behavior and, through networked ports and other interfaces, may initiate other changes, all implemented in the transmission of code.

- The machine does not summon creative variances of <blockquote> based on histories and contexts, but instead performs the programming of the element in the mode the programmers designed <blockquote> to perform—through all of the frontend and backend languages, compilers, and machine code. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 14:46:20](https://hyp.is/0nVALvSwEe22tnebRfDO6Q/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- However, in thinking through the intersubjective mediation of humans attaching multiple meanings to a single word or word-concept, and only one meaning attached to the element <blockquote>, there is still meaning attached to the element/code when the machine performs the function, however limited that may be in material/computational spaces. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 14:46:50](https://hyp.is/5FYpSPSwEe2oF88jvIirvA/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- In service to the philosophical and theoretical considerations of persuasion, if computer algorithms produce their own machinic contexts, which aren’t as highly unique as human contexts when associating concepts with words, then consideration of the performativity of code—of algorithms—takes root. Within the machinic context, the relationship of language and force binds in an ephemeral state. By ephemeral, I mean giving rise to a context for a written act to occur and with the close of the act, the context of the written act concluding, with the spatial and temporal elements of the context dissipating. Such theoretical ground calls to mind Thomas Rickert’s discussions of khôra. In examining the works for Kristeva, Derrida, and Ulmer, Ricket notes that “chōra transforms our senses of beginning, creation, and invention by placing them concretely within material environments, informational spaces, and affective (or bodily) registers” (252). This view illustrates another way of locating code and algorithms within rhetoric’s sphere as a khôraic being and non-being of what rhetoric encapsulates. While Rickert notes this conversation gives rise to rhetorical invention—for Derrida, rhetoric’s place in invention also calls attention—albeit briefly—to the spatial and temporal dimensions which discourse (and I would add the performativity of computer code) resides. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:15:19](https://hyp.is/3xCmnvS0Ee2SSRe0bs4wlQ/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

   - Annotation: What?

- The reciprocal and reflexive nature of algorithms in transactional inventions highlights the relationships in the network of actants, drawing upon Latour’s actor-network theory. The non-human actant computer algorithm performs in the interaction of inputs and outputs of data. In some sense, Latour’s idea of the “delegation to non-humans” wherein objects define how people or other objects move or respond, hints at a type of agency. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:16:30](https://hyp.is/CYAdxPS1Ee2Ug1-62laSBA/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- Interdisciplinary theorist Lucas Introna, who routinely publishes on the ethics of technology and surveillance, argues that the performativity of computer code should be understood in terms of the encoding process from agent—to transmission—to receiver, and as such encoded language objects are extensions of agency. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:19:47](https://hyp.is/fttKEvS1Ee2DO6MlXmoknA/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- the changes algorithms produce and affect as a force go deeper than agency and cut at persuasive design. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:20:55](https://hyp.is/p7OJIvS1Ee28QaeNlT2hag/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- Persuasive computer algorithms are written-only language objects with encoded agency, transactional invention, and embedded values, beliefs, and logics of the three rhetorical appeals performing functions that provide the grounds for human and non-human change. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:27:51](https://hyp.is/n23S-PS2Ee2K719eghg6vA/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- First, algorithms can be a systematic way of processing and organizing information for persuasive means that logic aids in ordering how humans and machines experience the world around them. Second, algorithms are decisive in inclusionary and exclusionary practices of using or discarding data that does not fit the structure of the algorithmic model. In this sense, if an algorithm’s structure only allows for data collection from websites with over 20 hyperlinks, the websites with less than 20 links will be excluded from the dataset. Finally, algorithms are quasi-objective ideological structures, in that the creation of an algorithmic structure relies upon the knowledge and experience base of the creator(s), and ideological bias will always seep through in the creation of the structure for better or for worse. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:28:41](https://hyp.is/vYyehvS2Ee2yYs-M-cCdsg/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- However, if our colleagues from literature and critical theory use the training and tools developed from their home disciplines in the field of critical code studies, then why not have digital rhetoricians use their social scientific and humanities-based theories and methodologies to study, theorize, and play with algorithms and code? — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:39:16](https://hyp.is/N709rvS4Ee2WUe9CpLa-vw/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public

- What makes a rhetorical code studies different (if at all) from a critical code studies? Certainly one variance would come from different methodological approaches, with critical code studies relying upon hermeneutics and rhetorical code studies also offering such an approach along with social science methodologies. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:40:24](https://hyp.is/YHvF2vS4Ee24kv9Q5R4-hQ/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: #Public
