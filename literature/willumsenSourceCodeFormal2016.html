        <p>Willumsen, E. C. (2016). <em>Source Code and Formal Analysis:
        A Hermeneutic Reading of Passage</em>. <a
        href="http://www.digra.org/digital-library/publications/source-code-and-formal-analysis-a-hermeneutic-reading-of-passage/">http://www.digra.org/digital-library/publications/source-code-and-formal-analysis-a-hermeneutic-reading-of-passage/</a>
        ## Abstract White-box analysis of video games is not an
        integrated part of the formal analysis. Rather, few scholars
        have investigated how an analysis of the source code can inform
        a hermeneutic reading of the game. In this paper I will present
        a reading of the source code of Passage (Rohrer, 2007), argue
        for why a focus on authorial intention is unnecessary when
        investigating the symbolism and metaphors of a game, and
        illustrate how the whitebox analysis can inform the formal
        analysis of the executed game. Finally, I shall discuss how the
        source code relates to the game as a ‘work’, and how it can be
        used for studies of symbolism and metaphors. Thus I will
        conclude that it is indeed a valuable method for game studies,
        albeit needing more studies on the textual relation between
        executed game and source code. ## Notes &gt; <strong>White-box
        testing</strong> (also known as <strong>clear box
        testing</strong>, <strong>glass box testing</strong>,
        <strong>transparent box testing</strong>, and <strong>structural
        testing</strong>) is a method of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing"
        title="Software testing">software testing</a> that tests
        internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to
        its functionality (i.e. <a

        <ul>
        <li>white-box testing is a necessary part of a <em>complete</em>
        analysis of a game, but not necessarily a necessary one</li>
        <li>only few have attempted to do a hermeneutic reading of a
        game’s source code and most of them based their analysis on a
        notion of internationality and authorship</li>
        <li>these notions of authorial intent have been critiqued as a

        some of the things that are usually interpreted on an abstract

        hardcoded into the game’s source code through naming. I believe
        that this allows us to disregard author statements and other

        express their intent and meaning of the game, and instead

        <p>One of the first scholars to point out the relevance of a
        reading of the code of a game is Konzack (2002), who in his
        otherwise very humanities focused seven layer analysis model
        includes both hardware and program code. He argues that “[i]n a
        complete analysis of a computer game every layer of the computer
        game in question should be analysed, but it is still possible to
        make an analysis of a computer game with out [sic] taking every
        layer into account”(Konzack, 2002, p. 92). (p. 1)</p>

        <p>I wish to illustrate that it is possible to conduct a
        hermeneutic reading of the source code, which is studied in
        relation to the executed game, without having to dive deep into
        algorithms or understand complicated syntax. Quite on the
        contrary, it should be possible for most game scholars who have
        just a little experience of reading or writing code to gain
        valuable insights from the analysis of the source code from the
        game in question. (p. 2)</p>

        <p>One thing existing applications have in common is their focus

        studies. (p. 2)</p>

        <p>This sort of focus on intent is old-fashioned and has been
        abandoned in most fields quite a while ago. One can therefore
        wonder why it is still the dominant mode within white-box
        analysis in game studies. (p. 3)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The aim is now to illustrate that similar interpretations can
        be made from a reading of the source code, rather than based on
        the creator statement. As such, the goal is to eliminate the
        notion of authorial intent in the analysis, and thereby not
        studying Rohrer’s creator statement as a paratext. (p. 4)</p>

        moving. As such, this case serves as an example of how code
        reading in the analysis can support arguments of
        interpretations. It also illustrates a strong relationship
        between player and avatar, which could be interpreted as if
        there is no character in the game, but only an avatar which is
        meant as a graphical representation of the player and is not
        articulated as a manifestation of Rohrer himself. (p. 6)</p>

        <p>The code in fig. 3 shows that the player can only ever have

        functions as a ‘pick-up’ of the spouse, is only generated if the
        player has not yet met the spouse, the spouse is not dead, and
        the spouse is not next to the player (that is, the spouse is not
        currently active). This is never commented upon in the creator
        statement, but can indeed inform the formal analysis of the
        game, as monogamous, heteronormative standards are hardcoded
        into the game. (p. 7)</p>

        the source code can take on the role as another text related to
        the main text, e.g. as a hypotext or paratext, or potentially as
