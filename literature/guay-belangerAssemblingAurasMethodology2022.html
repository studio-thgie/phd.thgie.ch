        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>Video games, while a digital art, live on physical media.
        Whether cartridge, magnetic tape or floppy disk, they degrade.
        Without care and study, they disappear and cannot be played
        again. While it might be possible to preserve play using
        emulation or video captures, scholars need to consider every
        option at their disposal to preserve video games for future
        study. This includes securing original versions of games and
        ephemera, recording play, interviewing game creators, and
        players, and much more. This article develops a new approach to
        conceptualise video games as material and cultural heritage, and
        proposes a methodology for their study, especially those for
        which there is no original version left.</p>

        history.</p>

        <p>Video games, as all software, needs to live on physical
        media. That makes them prone to <a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWM645TL?page=662&amp;annotation=undefined">Go
        to annotation</a>“bit rot, hardware failure, and format

        href="zotero://select/library/items/D5S5C3ZS">Guay-Bélanger,
        2022, p. 662</a>). The physical media are decaying and it’s
        getting more and more difficult to create the necessary systems
        to play the games.</p>
        <p>To truly study video games, they have to be played
        (preservation for use). At the same time, they are important
        audio-visual and material cultural heritage. The author’s
        approach tries to unify this two aspects.</p>
        <p>Video games, as all software, exist in between the physical
        and the digital. Software is the instruction, carved onto a
        physical medium, out of which a digital world can emerge.</p>
        <p>‘The cartridge or disk is a vessel with the wine, the stone
        upon which the writing was carved containing the deeper meaning
        born of words and syntax. It is the physical manifestation of
        code wrapped in layers of instructions that created the portable
        package, a world in itself containing a world within’ (Reinhard,
        2018, p. 93).</p>

        <p>The author criticizes that older lists of what needs to be
        preserved in video games often leaves out <em>the user</em>.</p>

        software needs a user; a video game emerges from the user’s
        interactions with the software’s rules and potentials for it to
        actually be, and so, the ancillary materials that enable or
        depend on and result from that running also need to be
        considered.” (<a

        <p>The problem is in preservation focused on technical aspects
        versus preservation for use.</p>
        <p>Ongoing processes of preservation of the media-object face
        many obstacles, such as all software. See <a

        the different problems these three aspects bring up for
        preservation.</p>

        <li>intertextuality: ‘meaning in a text can only ever be
        understood in relation to other texts; no work stands alone but
        is interlinked with the tradition that came before it and the
        context in which it is produced’ (Allen, 2000, p. i)</li>
        <li>paratext: <a

        to annotation</a>“formulates a simple algorithm that governs the
        whole of Paratexts: Paratext = peritext + epitext. The peritext
        includes elements ‘inside’ the confines of a bound
        volumeeverything between and on the covers, as it were. The
        epitext, then, denotes elements ‘outside’ the bound
        volume—public or private elements such as interviews, reviews,
        correspondence, diaries etc.—although Genette does comment that
        ‘in principle, every context serves as a paratext.’”
        (Koenig-Woodyard, 1999)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What counts as paratext can be defined fundamentally
        different. From technical material, such as drivers and text
        files, to paraphernalia.</p>
        <p>‘there is never a single or correct way to read a text, since
        every reader brings with him or her different expectations,
        interests, viewpoints, and prior reading experiences’ (Allen,
        2000,p.6–7)</p>
        <p>The author would radically include all forms of fan-labour as
        well. Nonetheless, paratextuality should be understood as a very
        fluid concept, especially when deciding what is text, and what
        is peripheral.</p>

        game stops being useful when all of the potential influences on
        a game are taken into account. By being flexible in what we
        consider to be central and peripheral to a game, the framework
        proposed here opens the door to new and varied positions.
        Limiting the number of items considered to be part of the game
        does not allow for the expression of the complexity of video
        games and their derivative material.” (<a

        All of which hold on to the game’s aura.” (<a

        can hold the original’s aura as well. Even if they are <a

        href="zotero://select/library/items/D5S5C3ZS">Guay-Bélanger,

        assemblages.</p>
        <ul>

        <p>Assemblages have kinship with the concept of intertextuality.

        interminglings that can move in many and various directions,

        interpretation could cause confusion in the understanding of an
