### Ergodic Literature

- ergodic points towards more effort than just eye movements and turning pages
- cybertext denotes structure, not content or genre
- long excursion on texts and labyrinths
- going into examples of ergodic lit
- databases introduced new possibilities for producing ergodic text

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=17&annotation=ZJG442U8) “For the first time, this breaks down concepts such as "the text itself" into two independent technological levels: the interface and the storage medium.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 17](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- aarseth describing source code on p.11 is interesting and insightful
- mentioning of the “ergodic textual machines”
- some words of heed towards literary research on cybertexts as well as the concept of social change through new technologies
- raising the question on what is a text
- Aarseth already being fed up with academic skirmishes in 1997

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=24&annotation=8GV8GJ4C) “Isn't the content of a text more important than these materialistic, almost ergonomic, concerns?” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 24](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- must be a sarcasto-rhetoric question, since cybertext is about structuring texts

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=24&annotation=9KZY3TRM) “If it [a difference] exists, it must be described in functional, rather than material or historical, terms.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 24](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- there you go

### Problems in Computer Semiotics

- focus on functionality of the different texts and medias, trying to get a pluralist perspective
- reading is not just between reader and text but also includes context and world
- on the fields focus on books and ignorance of any other textual media
- Aarseth adding cybertext as a textual definition such as phenomenological, semiotic, etc

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=31&annotation=TUTMSZTY) “[Cybertext as] as a material machine, a device capable of manipulating itself as well as the reader” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 31](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- going into the problems of computer semiotics, which seem to be ideologically influenced
- until recently, semiotics concentrated mostly on the static and linear, not bein able to encompass the dynamic and varied
- a very interesting part on complexity and autonomy (in response to Jensen differentiation of semiotics and signal processing) leading to a discussion on how a program will have results that couldn’t have been predicted by the programmer on p.27
- on the global stock market as a transgression of the semiosis-signal-processing threshold
- this longer, a bit tougher to read part, goes essentially into the problems of how meaning arises in between computational signal processing and human semiotics; is that not a bit the part that I’m also struggling with in understanding? I saw this process much more as a specific moment then an assemblage, but it would be interesting to map this out once

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=36&annotation=GXDKRQY5) “The crucial issue here is how to view systems that feature what is known, as emergent behavior, systems that are complex structures evolving unpredictably from an initial set of simple elements.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 36](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- on the problems of generative/emergent behaviour
- Andersen’s classification of semiotic signs: permanence, transience, handling and action; classes: interactive, actor, object, button, controller, layout, ghost
- Critique of Andersen’s classification as it is insufficient along the line of applying the system to buttons as well as it’s application on Breakout and Lemmings

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=47&annotation=UPJ9JCXJ) “When the relationship between surface sign and user is all that matters, the unique dual materiality of the cybernetic sign process. is disregarded. Without an understanding of this duality, however, analyses of communicative phenomena involving cybernetic sign production become superficial and incomplete.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 47](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- basically a call for action in 1997, and … THIS

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=47&annotation=97RXBTZ4) “In short, the dual nature of the cybernetic sign process can be described as follows: while some signification systems, such as painted pictures and printed books, exist on only one material level (i.e., the level of paint and canvas, or of ink and paper), others exist on two or more levels, as a book being read aloud (ink-paper and voicesoundwaves) or a moving picture being projected (the film strip and the image on the silver screen). In these latter cases, the relationship between the two levels may be termed trivial, as the transformation from one level to the other (what we might call the secondary sign production) will always be, if not deterministic, then at least dominated by the material authority of the first level. In the cybernetic sign transformation, however, the relationship might be termed arbitrary, because the internal, coded level can only be fully experienced by way of the external, expressive level.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 47](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- the in-depth explanation of the cybernetic sign process is pure gold as it is foundational to my dissertation project

### Textuality, Nonlinearity, and Interactivity

- I can’t follow the part on nonlinear text, there seems to be many reference to discourse that I’m not familiar with, but I’m also not sure if it’s important at the moment for me
- discussion of nonlinear vs. multilinear; the importance of defining the poit of perspective (writter, user, the net itself, the possible courses)
- hypermedia are topologically nonlinear
- when we describe things, ie as cybertext, it is important to outline if we describe the thing or doing the thing (writing vs writings)
- interactive as a term that doesn’t mean much

### Cyborg Aesthetics and the “Work in Movement”

- cyborg aesthetics!
- shout-out to Donna Haraway and her appropriation and theoretisation of the cyborg
- cyborg as play at the boundary of machine-humane
- writing as a cyborg technology
- text as a machine, symbiosis of sign, operator and medium; being of linguistic, historical and material phenomena
- cyborg fields being dominated by issues of domination and control; author, text, or reader control

## A Typology of Textual Communication

- reviewing previous efforts, such as Bordewijk and can Kaam’s typology of traffic patterns: allocution, consultation, registration, and conversation
- Aarseth is interested in textual systems, less the social ones
- explaining his methodology: categorizing texts then employing [correspondence analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_analysis) and pointing to possible shortcomings (which was interesting to me)

### The Typology

- text isn’t really defined and that is helping and hindering a proper analysis
- broad definition of text: relays verbal communication, thus is depending on material medium and is not equal to the information it transmits
- strings appearing for the ideal reader: scriptons (the reader might not read it accordingly)
- strings existing in text: textons
- texts consists of traversal function, the generation of scriptons from textons
- variables
    
    - See ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 72](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8)) for summarizing table
    - dynamics: amount of scriptons and textons
    - determinability: if adjacent scriptos stay the same or not
    - transiency: if the scriptons change by themselves or through interaction
    - perspective: im/personal
    - access: codex is random access, hypertext w/o search are more linear
    - linking: links, conditional links, no links
    - user functions: interpretative, explorative, configurative, textonic (user can add textons or traversal functions)

### The Texts

- he chose 23 texts based on the variables outlined before
- then applied the correspondence analysis with the help of Analytica producing some matrices that position the works according to their variables

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=80&annotation=35V8YR76) “The concept of text, always contested and problematized, is once again under reconfiguration. Should we use the same term for phenomena as diverse as Moby Dick and MUDs? Or for that matter, the I Ching and Moby Dick?” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 80](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- conclusion: reader might not be an appropriate term; they certainly must more then just read depending on the kind of text
- the avoidance of industry-provided terminology by falling back to the parameters is a nice move

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=81&annotation=QZ9FXS4U) “new media do not appear in opposition to the old but as emulators of features and functions that are already invented” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 81](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- based on anaylsis and conclusion, suggests cybertext as the term for texts which include calculation in the production of scriptons

## Hypertext Aesthetics

- aesthetics as the motives that produce hypertexts and their poetics
- hypertextual reading is not equivalent with writing, at least not with the writing the author can do; the semantic units/signs have different scopes and allow for different kinds of failures (the author can chain random letters to produce unmeaningful material, but play with the signs in a much broader scope)
- hypertext doesn’t seem much different from older writing media and it is less freely in terms of tmesis

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=85&annotation=UIRVWYF8) “We might say that hypertext punishes tmesis by controlling the text's fragmentation and pathways and by forcing the reader to pay attention to the strategic links.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 85](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=86&annotation=99ZSIQR4) “hypertext labyrinth (what I later call an ergodic aporia)” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 86](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))
- talking about hypertext as a ideological and technological category, applying proper discourse analysis
- web-based hypertext as having place and regaining parts of its aura, since it cannot be reproduced fully

## Paradigms of Hypertext

- I do love the inclusion of power-analysis in bits of Aarseth’ text

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=89&annotation=H499HXPP) “Contrary to Nelson's idealistic claim [computers are about human freedom], the purpose of computers is power, and hypertext is as much involved in that struggle for power as anything else.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 89](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=90&annotation=6TK62HZE) “To claim that hypertext is fulfilling "postmodern theory"-and that "postmodern theorists have been doing this (i.e., describing hypertext] without knowing it" (24)-is an attempt to colonize several rather different critical fields by replacing their empirical object or objects on the imperialist pretext that they did not really have one until now.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 90](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- deconstructing the ideology of hypertext as the the superior text
- fiction and narrative being of different types of categories and thus, can’t be the same
- the deep reading of hypertext fiction/narrative and what’s what eludes me at times

## The Sense of a Novel: Michael Joyce’s Afternoon

- interesting approach to critiquing tech vs. content

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=94&annotation=4W4X2RAZ) “Instead of asking, What have I read? the critic might become preoccupied with the question, Have I read all? and come to identify the task of interpretation as a task of territorial exploration and technological mastery.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 94](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- reverse engineering hypertext structures

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=95&annotation=X5TU2CJ7) “As one of the programers behind Storyspace, Afternoon's hypertext system, Bolter is in an excellent position to demystify the text. Afternoon is certainly mapable; it can be loaded into the full version of Storyspace and its links studied there in detail.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 95](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- pondering on the term interactive fiction

**_The Rhetoric of Hyperliteralture: Aporia and Epiphany_**

- on hypertext mechanisms and what they affect; from aporia to epiphany

**_The Poetics of Conflict: Ergodics versus Narration_**

- skipped this part; exhaustive discussion of Afternoon

## 5 Intrigue and Discourse in the Adventure Game

- recounting the beginnings of the arpanet/net/internet as well as the advent of _Adventure_, and how the latter migrated across the former

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=107&annotation=6RPMHXTL) “Mary Ann Buckles (1985, 79) argues convincingly that Adventure can be classified as "folk art," in contrast to the popular commercial genre it later gave birth to.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 107](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- explains how a adventure game works
- goes into _Adventure_’s derivates, as well as into the demise of the genre
- according to Brenda Laurel, the end of text adventures was due to the development of image based games

“According to Brenda Laurel (1991, 97n), the first graphical adventure game was created by Warren Robinett for Atari in 1979. In the early 1980s, computer graphics became better and cheaper, and so the adventure game genre, with its spatially oriented themes of travel and discovery, gradually migrated from text to pictures and, eventually, to three-dimensional "virtual reality" games like Doom, by John Romero, John Carmack, and Adrian Carmack (1993), or multipath movies like the current Hollywood CD-ROM productions.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 108](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- detailing the influence and importance of _Rogue_ on the genre and demise of text aventures, although ASCII based

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=109&annotation=ZBQJQ263) “Images, especially moving images, are more powerful representations of spatial relations than texts, and therefore this migration from text to graphics is natural and inevitable.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 109](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- positioning the ergodic structure of _Adventure_ as the base of pretty much all interactive games, despite these having much better graphics

**_A Schematic Model of Internal Structure_**

- see graphic p.104
- components: data, processing engines, interace, user
- going into the details of this generalized model
- talking about ideal and corruptible readers (players)

**_Some Issues in Advanture Game Critisicm_**

- adventure games are not novels, they are a genre in themselves, and, something new
- often missing historical perspectives

“Adventure, despite its obvious debt to Dungeons and Dragons, transcended the cultural position of a singular text and became a mythological urtext, located everywhere and nowhere, sometimes even incorrectly backdated to the early sixties.” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 114](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- on the adventure game and hypertext literature and their prominence in literature analysis, the former being “entertainment”, foreshadowing the ignorance on games as an important cultural product
- on players participation as just filling gaps, which is misleading

I skipped the literary analysis of most of the works.

## Conclusions: The Ideology of Influence

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/DS984T5A?page=187&annotation=XPHCU3QB) “But are we the cocreators of these images? Only in a noematic sense. The coded images are objectively there, just like encrypted messages that can be deciphered only with a certain key, and we can no more influence their appearance than we can influence a Rembrandt or a Van Gogh” ([Aarseth, 1997, p. 187](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/RLXNH2M8))

- pointing towards the illustion of cocreation, participation and the like (the player does not touch the codebase, not altering the rules/ergodic structures of the game)

## Annotations
> The performance of their reader takes place all in his head, while the user of cybertext also performs in an extranoematic sense. During the cybertextual process, the user will have effectuated a semiotic sequence, and this selective movement is a work of physical construction that the various concepts of "reading" do not account for. (p. 8)

> The problem was that, while they focused on what was being read, I focused on what was being read from. (p. 10)

> In a cybertext, however, the distinction is crucial-and rather different; when you read from a cybertext, you are constantly reminded of inaccessible strategies and paths not taken, voices not heard. (p. 10)

> The cybertext reader, on the other hand, is not safe, and therefore, it can be argued, she is not a reader. The cybertext puts its would-be reader at risk: the risk of rejection. The effort and energy demanded by the cybertext of its reader raise the stakes of interpretation to those of intervention. (p. 11)

> The study of cybertexts reveals the ~isprision of the spaciodynamic metaphors of narrative theory, b~ciu.iseergodic literature incarnates these models in a way linear text narratives do not. (p. 11)

> Digital systems for information storage and retrieval, popularly known as databases, signified new ways of using textual material. The database is in principle similar to the filing cabinet but with a level of automation and speed that made radically different textual practices possible. On the physical level, the surface of reading was divorced from the stored information. (p. 17)

> For the first time, this breaks down concepts such as "the text itself" into two independent technological levels: the interface and the storage (p. 17)

> On the social level, huge texts could be browsed, searched, and updated by several people at once, and from different places on the globe, operations that only superficially seem to resemble what we used to call "reading" and "writing." (p. 18)

> Computer programs, complex lists of formal instructions written in specially designed, artificial languages, can be seen as a new type of the rhetorical figure apostrophe, the addressing of inanimate or abstract objects, with the magical difference that it actually provokes a response. Short, simple programs are often linear, but longer programs generally consist of collections of interdependent fragments, with repeating loops, cross-references, and discontinuous "jumps" back and forth between sections. Given the seminatural vocabulary of some modern programing languages, it is not uncommon for programers to write poems in them, often with the constraint that the "poegrams" (or whatever) must make sense to the machine as welJ. (p. 18)

> This gives rise to a double standard of aesthetics, often in conflict: efficiency and clarity. Since speed is a major quality in computer aesthetics, an unreadable program might perform much faster than a comprehensible one. The poetics of computer program writing is constantly evolving, and through paradigms such as object orientation it inspires practical philosophies and provides hermeneutic models for organizing and understanding the world, both directly (through programed systems) and indirectly (through the worldviews of computer engineers). (p. 18)

> Although the output of these generators are linear stories or poems, the systems themselves are clearly ergodic textual machines, with unlimited possibility for variation. (p. 19)

> Life in the MUD is literary, relying on purely textual strategies, and it therefore provides a unique laboratory for the study of textual self-expression and self-creation, themes that are far from marginal in the practice of literary theory. (p. 20)

> In the context of literature, this has led to claims that digital technology enables readers to become authors, or at least blurs the (supposedly political) distinction between the two, and that the reader is allowed to create his or her own "story" by "interacting" with "the computer." (p. 21)

> In the context of this study, the question of the text becomes a question of verbal media and their functional differences (what role does a medium play?), and only subsequently a question of semantics, influence, otherness, mental events, intentionality, and so forth. (p. 22)

> Isn't the content of a text more important than these materialistic, almost ergonomic, concerns? (p. 24)

> If it exists, it must be described in functional, rather than material or historical, terms. (p. 24)

> As can be inferred from its etymology, a cybertext must contain some kind of information feedback loop. (p. 26)

> The conventional split between text and reading (between the "intentional object" and the "mental event"), or signifiant and signifie, is not an impermeable membrane: leaks occur constantly; through various stages of reception such as editing, marketing, translation, criticism, rediscovery, canonization, or banishment. (p. 27)

> These well-known processes are not entirely trivial, however, because they remind us that a text can never be reduced to a standalone sequence of words. There will always be context, convention, contamination; sociohistorical mediation in one form or another. (p. 27)

> The differences in teleological orientation-the different ways in which the reader is invited to "complete" a textandthe texts' various self-manipulating devices are what the conceptof cybertext is about. (p. 27)



> As the cyber prefix indicates, the text is seen as a machine-not metaphorically but as a mechanical device for the production and consumption of verbal -signs. (p. 28)

> Cybertext, as now should be clear, is the wide range (or perspective) of possible textualities seen as a typology of machines, as various kinds of literary communication systems where the functional differences among the mechanical parts play a defining role in determining the aesthetic process. (p. 29)

> the perspective of the text as a material machine, a device capable of manipulating itself as well as the reader (p. 31)

> For semiotics, as for linguistics, texts are chains of signs and, therefore, linear by definition (Hjelmslev 1961, 30). As Tomas Maldonado (1993, 58-66) argues in his excellent essay on virtual reality, semiotics (with particular reference to the work of A. J. Greimas) has not managed to meet the challenge from "a whole typology of iconic constructions, very different from those studied by semiotics · until now." (p. 33)

> When a s~tem is sufficiently complex, it will, by intention, fault, or coincidence, inevitably produce results that could not be predicted even by the system designer. (p. 34)

> Even if there is no reason to suspect that anything but meaningless operations of shifting zeroes and ones go on inside the programed machine, it nevertheless displays a significant behavior that is not-and in fact could not-be anticipated by its programer, even if it could be claimed that it was "intended." (p. 34)

> The crucial issue here is how to view systems that feature what is known, as emergent behavior, systems that are complex structures evolving unpredictably from an initial set of simple elements. (p. 36)



> In Hypercard, for instance, a button can dragged, changed, disabled, highlighted, even made invisible, or off the screen. It can also be made to behave according to Andersen's definition, but this is clearly a subset of its abilities. A •Hypercard button, in fact, can fit any of Andersen's sign categories and still be recognized as a button by its users (p. 42)

> The fifth phase, invisible, was not present at the taking of this screen picture. (p. 43)

> The lemming is then transformed from a general purpose lemming (i.e., one that fearlessly marches straight ahead) to a special purpose lemming, which will engage in the special task with equal single-mindedness. (p. 45)

Without an understanding of this duality, however, analyses of communicative phenomena involving cybernetic sign production become superficial and incomplete. (p. 47)

> In short, the dual nature of the cybernetic sign process can be described as follows: while some signification systems, such as painted pictures and printed books, exist on only one material level (i.e., the level of paint and canvas, or of ink and paper), others exist on two or more levels, as a book being read aloud (ink-paper and voicesoundwaves) or a moving picture being projected (the film strip and the image on the silver screen). In these latter cases, the relationship between the two levels may be termed trivial, as the transformation from one level to the other (what we might call the secondary sign production) will always be, if not deterministic, then at least dominated by the material authority of the first level. In the cybernetic sign transformation, however, the relationship might be termed arbitrary, because the internal, coded level can only be fully experienced by way of the external, expressive level. (p. 47)

> (When inactive, the program and data of the internal level can of course be studied and described as objects in their own right but not as ontological equivalents of their representations at the external level.) (p. 47)

> The discrepancy between Nelson and his critics, therefore, can easily be explained: while he is talking of text and writings (as constructed objects), they are talking of readings and writing (as temporal process (p. 51)

> To declare a system interactive is to endorse it with a magic power. (p. 55)

> The cultural potency of the cyborg figure is due not least to its many interstitial positions between us and the machines, between the alien and the familiar, between dependency and enhancement, terror and life support, creation and destruction, metal and flesh. As such it formulates a popular theme that dates back to the Daedalian and Promethean myths of classical literature: the ambivalence of material self-enhancemt'nt. (p. 61)

> For instance, the strange "face" on the surface of Mars is a text only because (1) it has the shape of a face sign, (2) it has been identified as such by someone, and (3) it is produced physically by optical and geological conditions. (p. 62)
> – <i>Zak McKracken</i> was released in 1988 ;)
> This text is an impurity, a site of struggle between medium, sign, and operator. The fragments produced are. clearly not authored by anyone. They are pulverized and reconnected echoes of meaning, and the meaning that can be made from them is not the meaning that once existed. (p. 64)
> – By non, or all. Which is to say, that there is no hierarchy in agency


> The concept of text, always contested and problematized, is once again under reconfiguration. Should we use the same term for phenomena as diverse as Moby Dick and MUDs? Or for that matter, the I Ching and Moby Dick? (p. 80)

> Any text directs its user, by convention, mechanism, or social interaction. The reader is (and has always been) a necessary part of the text, but one that we now realize can (or must) perform more than one function. If these are all texts, perhaps the word reader no longer has any clear meaning. (p. 81)

> The important lesson to be learned from discontinuous and forking texts is that when two readers approach a text they do not have to encounter the same words and sentences in order to agree that it probably was the same text. And this is not new: it is a classical feature of reading, as Roland Barthes points out in his comment on tmesis (1975). (p. 81)

> new media do not appear in opposition to the old but as emulators of features and functions that are already invented (p. 81)

> For Roland Barthes, tmesis is the reader's unconstrained skipping and skimming of passages, a fragmentation of the linear text expression that is totally beyond the author's control. Hypertext re(lding is in fact quite the opposite: as the reader explores the labyrinth, she can not afford to tread lightly through the text but must scrutinize the links and venues in order to avoid meeting the same text fragments over and over again (p. 85)

> We might say that hypertext punishes tmesis by controlling the text's fragmentation and pathways and by forcing the reader to pay attention to the strategic links. (p. 85)

> This is not, however, Barthes's "textual bliss" but, rather, the reader's textual claustrophobia as he skims the dejalu nodes. (p. 86)

> I argue elsewhere argue that (p. 86)

> Hypertext is as much an ideological category as a techn_ologicalone, constructed by its presumed diffeience from, and superiorit)lto, paper media, and we should take care not to let this myth subconsciously influence our readings of individual texts. (p. 86)

> With codex and hypertext alike, to get the word out one has to copy it so that identical physical objects can be sent over a large area. A World Wide Web document, on • the other hand, exist fully only in one place-on the World Wide Web server where the author (or document owner) has placed it. The work of art thus regains a sense of place. (p. 88)

> The ontology of the Web text is close to that of a painting, where the artist may modify and revise the same work in a process that may take many years. (p. 88)

> Here, the work of art regains parts of its aura, its "here and now," through the sense that it cannot be fully copied and reproduced, since it has a singular place on the network and also a temporal dimension, a dynamic lifetime. (p. 88)

> Contrary to Nelson's idealistic claim, the purpose of computers is power, and hypertext is as much involved in that struggle for power as anything else. (p. 89)

> To claim that hypertext is fulfilling "postmodern theory"-and that "postmodern theorists have been doing this (i.e., describing hypertext] without knowing it" (24)-is an attempt to colonize several rather different critical fields by replacing their empirical object or objects on the imperialist pretext that they did not really have one until now. (p. 90)

> Afternoon has often been labeled postmodernist, and it does contain many literary devices typically associated with postmodernism (the metonymic mixing of fragments and genres, self-commentary and intrusions by the "author," typographical variation, metaleptic breaks (for a spoof on interactive technologies and technologists, see figure 4.1). But in the hypertext environment of Afternoon, these devices are naturalized and therefore do not cause the subversion they might have in a codex format. (p. 93)

> Instead of asking, What have I read? the critic might become preoccupied with the question, Have I read all? and come to identify the task of interpretation as a task of territorial exploration and technological mastery. (p. 94)

> As one of the programers behind Storyspace, Afternoon's hypertext system, Bolter is in an excellent position to demystify the text. Afternoon is certainly mapable; it can be loaded into the full version of Storyspace and its links studied there in detail. (p. 95)

> Mary Ann Buckles (1985, 79) argues convincingly that Adventure can be classified as "folk art," in contrast to the popular commercial genre it later gave birth to. (p. 107)

> The formula was simple: take a popular fiction genre, for example, the detective novel, create a background story (the more stereotypical the better, since the players would need less initiation), create a map for the player to move around in, objects to manipulate, characters to interact with, a plot tree or graph with several outcomes, depending on the player's previous decisions, and add descriptions, dialogue, error messages, and a vocabulary for the player. This literary database is accessed via a subprogram called a parser that interprets the player's input commands (e.g., hit dragon, eat sandwich, go north). Once an action has been identified, the program changes the database and displays a message about the outcome, until the player quits the game, wins, or "dies" and must start again. (p. 107)

> According to Brenda Laurel (1991, 97n), the first graphical adventure game was created by Warren Robinett for Atari in 1979. In the early 1980s, computer graphics became better and cheaper, and so the adventure game genre, with its spatially oriented themes of travel and (p. 108)

> Images, especially moving images, are more powerful representations of spatial relations than texts, and therefore this migration from text to graphics is natural and inevitable. (p. 109)



> Adventure, despite its obvious debt to Dungeons and Drag- (p. 114)

> ons, transcended the cultural position of a singular text and became a mythological urtext, located everywhere and nowhere, sometimes even incorrectly backdated to the early sixties. (p. 115)

> Compared to all other literary formats, including hypertext novels, the adventure game's textual structure is an alien, too far removed from the genus of hegemonic literature to be recognized by any but a few xenophiles, who risk professional suspicion or ridicule when they dare suggest the pertinence of their newfound, strange looking object. (p. 116)

> But are we the cocreators of these images? Only in a noematic sense. The coded images are objectively there, just like encrypted messages that can be deciphered only with a certain key, and we can no more influence their appearance than we can influence a Rembrandt or a Van Gogh (p. 187)
