        <p>Input is bad if it is longer than its output; both are

        <blockquote>
        <p>The Turing machine of 1936, as the principle controller of
        any computer, solved a basic problem of the modern age: how to
        note with finitely long and ultimately whole numbers the real,
        and therefore typically infinitely long, numbers on which
        technology and engineering have been based since Viète’s time.

        <blockquote>
        <p>either we write code that in the manner of natural constants
        reveals the determinations of the matter itself, but at the same
        time pay the price of millions of lines of code and billions of
        dollars for digital hardware; or else we leave the task up to
        machines that derive code from their own environment, although
        we then cannot read—that is to say: articulate—this code

        <blockquote>
        <p>anybody who has written code even only once, be it in a
        high-level programming language or assembly, knows two very
        simple things from personal experience. For one, all words from
        which the program was by necessity produced and developed only
        lead to copious errors and bugs; for another, the program will
        suddenly run properly when the programmer’s head is emptied of
        words (p. 61)</p>
