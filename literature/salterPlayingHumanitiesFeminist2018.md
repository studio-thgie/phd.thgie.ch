## Abstract
Both game studies and the broader digital humanities value the public scholar: the intersection of games academic spaces with games journalism and online communities offers lots of valuable opportunities for debate and shared knowledge. However, participation within these communities comes at very different potential costs for scholars based on their identities, and the currency of one network becomes fuel for a witch hunt from another. Acting as a public scholar brings with it risk that is inherently tied to a scholar’s identity and position: gender, race, sexual identity, and other elements of identity not only bring intense scrutiny but often

Being an academic in digital humanities or video game studies means being public, as this is a common, almost assumed, practice in the fields. That means, opting out is most probably not an option. This puts marginalized voices in danger, as they are often getting backlashed at, when being public.

What it shares with the tech world, is that marginalized voices are often the least amplified. This is furthered by a hierarchy of fields, whereas game studies is clearly bellow STEM.

Games are, I’m sorry to report, a joke that have managed nevertheless to eke out a place in the study of arts and culture”” ([Salter and Blodgett, 2018, p. 468](zotero://select/library/items/Q9PYM3VL))

In STEM as in the game industry, more technical fields are higher up in the hierarchies and usually male dominated. This parallels digital humanities, especially regarding the technical barriers to entry and participation.
