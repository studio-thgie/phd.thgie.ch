## Notes
## The Conditional Cyberimage

- introducing the need for an analysis of the [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/RB8KCMJI?page=264&annotation=undefined) “aesthetics of in-game photography” ([Gerling et al., 2022, p. 264](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/4AH8M55B))
- arguing that Overweg’s work at the limit of a game’s structures reveals in-game photography depending on the source game as **conditional cyberimage**
- defining in-game photography
- the relation between in-game photography its the source game is paradox: the game, gameness or gameplay is mostly absent, but the aesthetics of it are still present in the photo, similar to the machinima format

“If a game is transformed into a film, the gameness or “gameplay” ceases to exist. In other words, “the game loses its rule set completely and ceases to be a game after all”.” ([Gerling et al., 2022, p. 268](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/4AH8M55B))

- I had similar thoughts about screenshots and screencasts becoming secondary literature for a game; but, they might as well as be something entirely else
- game art is a relapse, from ergodic media to the [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/RB8KCMJI?page=269&annotation=undefined) “object of a viewer’s gaze” ([Gerling et al., 2022, p. 269](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/4AH8M55B))
- author not happy with omission of discussion of significance of gameplay for in-game photography

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/RB8KCMJI?page=270&annotation=undefined) “I believe, though, that the way a game is played is inscribed in the making of in-game photographs.” ([Gerling et al., 2022, p. 270](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/4AH8M55B))

- proposing to look at game research from perspective of visual culture instead

- in-game photography being highly dependent on game design and the game engine

- how do visual characteristics relate to gameplay/gameness
- gameplay vs. aesthetics / gameplay and aesthetics
- next to game or text, a video game can/should be conceptualized as image
- the image in game can be static, moving or interactive; the later being a image act (Bildakt)
- …or as manipulable double image, whereas the latter is image and invisible code (double-sided)

Austin’s speech act theory as well as from Horst Bredekamp’s work on Image Acts41, he conceptualizes the computer game as an image act (Bildakt). Due to the double-sided nature of digital images as proposed by Frieder Nake42, Hensel suggests regarding a digital image on a computer as a manipulable “double image”.43 Such images simultaneously consist of a visual surface and an invisible underside made up of (machine readable) code. Emphasizing the coded under-side of the image, Hensel goes on to say that computer game images are better understood as performative images and not as representational images. While playing a game, the players do more than merely appreciate the aesthetics of the computer game image; Hensel argues that they also interact with these images during gameplay. In other words, interacting with the game’s images is an essential part of the gameplay performance.” ([Gerling et al., 2022, p. 273](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/4AH8M55B))

- ergodic as the non-trivial effort on behalf of the player to travers a game

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/RB8KCMJI?page=276&annotation=undefined) “A cyberimage is then a hybrid of a machine (the computer) and image (all visual signs perceivable by humans involved in computer gaming) where each realized sequence of images depends on the performance of a player with the machine which is in turn evaluated by the machine (Aarseth 1997).” ([Gerling et al., 2022, p. 276](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/4AH8M55B))

- games having a gameplay condition, a resistance towards the player in what she is able to do in-game

## Three conditionalities of in-game photographs

1. dependence on the conditional cyberimage (human condition)
2. requiring gameplay skills (gameplay condition)
3. aesthetic condition

- digital games can be conceptualized as doubly conditional images

## Conditionality: Bedingtheit

> (1) in einem logischen Sinne die Folge in einer wenn-dann-Beziehung; (2) im Hinblick auf Realverhältnisse die Wirkung einer Ursache. Im weiteren Sinne bedeutet B., dass jede Erscheinung hinsichtlich ihrer Entstehung wie ihrer Existenz in einem unabtrennbaren Bedingungszusammenhang mit den anderen sie umgebenden empirischen Gegebenheiten steht. Von notwendiger B. spricht man, wenn bestimmte Umstände oder Gegebenheiten vorliegen müssen, damit eine empirische Erscheinung gegeben sein kann; von zufälliger, i.S. nicht-notwendiger B. ist die Rede, wenn bestimmte Umstände gegeben sein müssen, damit überhaupt sich etwas vollziehen oder ereignen kann, ohne dass diese Ereignisse durch die Umstände notwendig determiniert wären. z.B. ist jede Handlung insofern bedingt, als sie von bestimmten Umständen, situativen Gegebenheiten, Realisierungsmöglichkeiten u. a.m. auszugehen hat (d.i. notwendige konkrete Voraussetzungen), ohne dass damit die spezifische Handlung eindeutig und notwendig festgelegt wäre. – [https://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/philosophie/bedingtheit/276](https://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/philosophie/bedingtheit/276)

## Annotations
> A detachment from the game is characteristic of in-game photographs: There can only be traces of the gameplay or the game engine left, and these only to the extent that they are literally transformed into visible form (e. g. visible effects of glitches), since in-game photography emphasizes the visual layer of the source game. (p. 271)

> Game studies’ emphasis on the image (p. 272)

> 1,000-person team of game designers and developers of different kinds29 who designed not only a photorealistic but also a socio-realistic world (p. 273)

> “As camera avatars, players not only navigate through the game world, they film it as well” (p. 273)

> Thomas Hensel emphasizes this action dimension of game images: Drawing on Kenneth Burke’s theory of action and John L. Austin’s speech act theory as well as from Horst Bredekamp’s work on Image Acts41, he conceptualizes the computer game as an image act (Bildakt). Due to the double-sided nature of digital images as proposed by Frieder Nake42, Hensel suggests regarding a digital image on a computer as a manipulable “double image”.43 Such images simultaneously consist of a visual surface and an invisible underside made up of (machine readable) code. Emphasizing the coded under-side of the image, Hensel goes on to say that computer game images are better understood as performative images and not as representational images. While playing a game, the players do more than merely appreciate the aesthetics of the computer game image; Hensel argues that they also interact with these images during gameplay. In other words, interacting with the game’s images is an essential part of the gameplay performance. (p. 275)

> In his book Egoshooter,45 Stephan Günzel analyses the spatiality and pictorial nature (Bildlichkeit) of first person-shooter games, in particular. He focuses on the construction of their image as well as its cybernetic nature, referring to computer games as “interactive image objects”.46 The notion of the image object is derived from phenomenologist Edmund Husserl, for whom an image consisted of a tripartite structure: the image carrier, image content, and image object. (p. 276)

> It is remarkable, though, that none of the authors refers to its inherent ergodicity.51 The ergodicity of the game image describes its specific condition. If there is indeed a shift away from ludology, narratology, and the computer-game-as-cybertext towards a pictorial understanding of games and the game-as-image, then the authors just cited seem to omit the logical next step, which is to acknowledge that games are not merely interactive images but also cyberimages. (p. 276)

> Unlike the conditional cyberimage of the computer game, the interactive image is a characteristic of interactive media art, as Olli Leino has suggested.52 Accordingly, artworks like Legible City by Jeffrey Shaw53 can be operated by means of an interface. They can be freely navigated by a user, as the user controls the camera in this virtual world at will. Interactive media art, however, lacks the ergodic dimension of computer games as it does not evaluate the quality of the interaction. In other words, users of interactive media art can neither fail nor succeed when interacting with a piece of media art. Computer games as images, however, are conditional on the functioning of a cybernetic system and the performance of a player (p. 277)

> Although games with three-dimensional photorealistic landscapes have a distinctly different visual appearance than two-dimensional games like Tetris, they both possess what Olli Leino calls a gameplay condition.59 Following Sartre’s notion of the human condition, the gameplay condition describes the resistance that a game presents to a player and that limits their freedom to do whatever they want in a game. (p. 278)

> The interactive image of the death screen results from a failure to meet the conditions required by the conditional image of the computer game. (p. 279)

> Contrary to interactive media art, the computer game image is not about performing any kind of (inter)action; instead, it’s concerned with performing the right (inter) action at the right time and in the right place against the resistance of the game. (p. 279)

> In most computer games, common gameplay action hardly ever takes place near the limits of the designed and programmed game world. (p. 282)

> The strategy behind Overweg’s photographs can thus be described – drawing on Galloway – as a “foregrounding” of the “apparatus” which games are made of, hence exposing the mediality of the given game. (p. 282)
