        <p>In his book Egoshooter,45 Stephan Günzel analyses the
        spatiality and pictorial nature (Bildlichkeit) of first
        person-shooter games, in particular. He focuses on the
        construction of their image as well as its cybernetic nature,
        referring to computer games as “interactive image objects”.46
        The notion of the image object is derived from phenomenologist
        Edmund Husserl, for whom an image consisted of a tripartite
        structure: the image carrier, image content, and image object.

        <p>It is remarkable, though, that none of the authors refers to
        its inherent ergodicity.51 The ergodicity of the game image
        describes its specific condition. If there is indeed a shift
        away from ludology, narratology, and the
        computer-game-as-cybertext towards a pictorial understanding of
        games and the game-as-image, then the authors just cited seem to
        omit the logical next step, which is to acknowledge that games
        are not merely interactive images but also cyberimages.

        <blockquote>
        <p>Unlike the conditional cyberimage of the computer game, the
        interactive image is a characteristic of interactive media art,
        as Olli Leino has suggested.52 Accordingly, artworks like
        Legible City by Jeffrey Shaw53 can be operated by means of an
        interface. They can be freely navigated by a user, as the user
        controls the camera in this virtual world at will. Interactive
        media art, however, lacks the ergodic dimension of computer
        games as it does not evaluate the quality of the interaction. In
        other words, users of interactive media art can neither fail nor
        succeed when interacting with a piece of media art. Computer
        games as images, however, are conditional on the functioning of
        a cybernetic system and the performance of a player (p. 277)</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>Although games with three-dimensional photorealistic
        landscapes have a distinctly different visual appearance than
        two-dimensional games like Tetris, they both possess what Olli
        Leino calls a gameplay condition.59 Following Sartre’s notion of
        the human condition, the gameplay condition describes the
        resistance that a game presents to a player and that limits
        their freedom to do whatever they want in a game. (p. 278)</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>The interactive image of the death screen results from a
        failure to meet the conditions required by the conditional image
        of the computer game. (p. 279)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Contrary to interactive media art, the computer game image is
        not about performing any kind of (inter)action; instead, it’s
        concerned with performing the right (inter) action at the right
        time and in the right place against the resistance of the game.

        <blockquote>
        <p>In most computer games, common gameplay action hardly ever
        takes place near the limits of the designed and programmed game
        world. (p. 282)</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>The strategy behind Overweg’s photographs can thus be
        described – drawing on Galloway – as a “foregrounding” of the
        “apparatus” which games are made of, hence exposing the
        mediality of the given game. (p. 282)</p>
