## Bibliography


## Abstract
"Hello World" is one of the first programs that computer scientists write in a programming language. The program, usually only a few lines of code, causes the computer to output a greeting, as if it were speaking. The Lisp (List Processing language) version of such a program, for example, looks like this: (DEFUN HELLO-WORLD ()

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=1&annotation=D7HQQZT4)“"Hello" and "World" have significance, just as the function name "print" has a significance that goes far beyond its instructions to the computer and gestures toward a material culture of ink and writing surfaces.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=1&annotation=4HKKGX7W)“While we examine programming architecture and admire modularity and efficiency, the study of computer code does not currently emphasize interpretation, the search for and production of meaning.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=2&annotation=R9ML9US4)“To critique code merely for its functionality or aesthetics is to approach code with only a small portion of our analytic tools.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=2&annotation=565Y2VGT)“People like to project humanity onto the computer, but is it possible that with regard to coding we do just the opposite and strip the code of its human significance, imagining that it is a sign system within which the extensive analyses of semiotic systems and signification, connotation, and denotation do not apply?” ([Marino, 2012, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=4&annotation=NNHQLYYE)“While computer scientists can theorize on the most useful approaches to code, humanities scholars can help by conjecturing on the meaning of code to all those who encounter it both directly by reading it or indirectly by encountering the effects of the programs it creates. In effect, I am proposing that we can read and explicate code the way we might explicate a work of literature in a new field of inquiry that I call Critical Code Studies (CCS).” ([Marino, 2012, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=4&annotation=R72YCFZ9)“"There are division and distinctions between what the code is and does," he notes. This relationship with the coding structures and their processes is what we must trace, interrogate, and map.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=4&annotation=GSIWRQVL)“Critical Code Studies (CCS) is an approach that applies critical hermeneutics to the interpretation of computer code, program architecture, and documentation within a sociohistorical context. CCS holds that lines of code are not value-neutral and can be analyzed” ([Marino, 2012, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=5&annotation=RLCQJBPH)“using the theoretical approaches applied to other semiotic systems in addition to particular interpretive methods developed particularly for the discussions of programs.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=5&annotation=CLCC5VPL)“Critical Code Studies follows the work of Critical Legal Studies, in that it practitioners apply critical theory to a functional document (legal document or computer program) to explicate meaning in excess of the document's functionality, critiquing more than merely aesthetics and efficiency.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=5&annotation=KHFZUMWC)“Much of the current examination of code seems to revolve around efficiency, reusability, and modularity. My own critical approach will stress meaning, implication, and connotation, though not in terms of a self-contained system of meaning but with respect to the broader social contexts.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=5&annotation=BMNPANJI)“CCS will require the artful combination of knowledge of programming languages and knowledge of interpretive approaches” ([Marino, 2012, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=5&annotation=H7QT9K68)“If as Wendy Hui Kyong Chun has announced, "software is ideology" we might also say computer code is ideology, yet an ideology that is doubly hidden by our illiteracy and by the very screens on which its output delights and distracts” ([Marino, 2012, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=6&annotation=F2EPQWUU)“Fundamental to CCS is the assumption that code is a social, semiotic system employing grammar and rhetoric. As Rita Raley argues, "Code may in a general sense be opaque and legible only to specialists, much like a cave painting's sign system, but it has been inscribed, programmed, written. It is conditioned and concretely historical"” ([Marino, 2012, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=6&annotation=XUTR9FV8)“Adrian MacKenzie writes, "Code is written and run within situated practices, with reference to particular domains, and within particular orderings and disorderings of collective life. Its forms and abstractions are attached to lives" (19). The way this sign system circulates within actor-networks of computers and machines is also the way it develops connotations worthy of interpretation.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=7&annotation=L2877STG)“Critical Code Studies may observe some of Kittler's suggested restraint, keeping code from becoming a controlling, transcendental imaginary, but in examining code in context our approach will look towards and beyond characters to interpret gestures, performances, and possibilities” ([Marino, 2012, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=7&annotation=C2687VY3)“What can be interpreted? Everything. The code, the documentation, the comments, the structures - all will be open to interpretation.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=7&annotation=UQK84X6L)“Within the code, there will be the actual symbols but also, more broadly, procedures, structures, and gestures. There will be paradigmatic choices made in the construction of the program, methods chosen over others and connotations.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=7&annotation=R86W9NBM)“In addition to symbols and characters in the program files themselves, paratextual features will also be important for informed readers. The history of the program, the author, the programming language, the genre, the funding source for the research and development (be it military, industrial, entertainment, or other), all shape meaning,” ([Marino, 2012, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=7&annotation=ZM9LWUJA)“The goal need not be code analysis for code's sake, but analyzing code to better understand programs and the networks of other programs and humans they interact with, organize, represent, manipulate, transform, and otherwise engage.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=8&annotation=LJ7QG32C)“Thus the "World" the program greets has expanded to include other programmers at computers with Internet access (qualifiers that constrain the world to an absurdly tiny portion of the Earth's population)” ([Marino, 2012, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=8&annotation=668MN352)“code is not merely a means or procedure, it is a text, which is often accessible after the program has executed” ([Marino, 2012, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=9&annotation=M9N2WDC3)“As Cayley notes, in these new media objects, code is not merely instrumental but rather a performative, transformative, mediating process.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=9&annotation=HEGKHSKS)“an interpreter could collaborate with someone who is literate in the language, building networks of literature, and coalitions of meaning building. We might consider such fluency "cyborg literacy."” ([Marino, 2012, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=9&annotation=BCIWN6RX)“key to CCS is an understanding that the act of encoding is not a question of finding one correct command out of a codex of commands, but of choosing (and at times creating) a particular combination of lines to build a structure that resonates and operates aesthetically, functionally, and even conceptually with the other discourse of encoded objects as well as mathematical and natural language discourse.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=10&annotation=VXMWX2DI)“their reading is not limited to the performance of the code, as they also stress "more purposeful arrangements of code by the programmer," noting for example that even the visual of code is for human readers, since "the same code could be expressed in any shape or arrangement and would run the same output."” ([Marino, 2012, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=11&annotation=467WEK62)“Ultimately, they conclude that "All coding inevitably involves double coding. 'Good' code simultaneously specifies a mechanical process and talks about this mechanical process to a human reader"” ([Marino, 2012, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=12&annotation=IFY5DVDZ)“Raley interrogates the notion of a "deep structure of the code," examining the metaphors and mythologies of "code," asking, "Is code then semiotic?" (5). Throughout the essay, Raley contrasts "the discourse of the foundational architecture of code that mines the depths to produce a geology (or mythology) of surface" with "the discourse of computational code in terms of inaccessible, inscrutable processes" (2). Raley identifies "the difference of the sign system of code" as "its executability, the operative transformation of a message from one symbolic form to another" (12). Yet it is this dual state as signs and operations that offers much to the play of interpretation of code that she performs.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=13&annotation=4WEMEZRZ)“The challenge will be to apply such readings to less intentionally artistic programs.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=14&annotation=BCC5FANN)“Anxieties can arise when the operations of the computer are mystified to the extent that users lose sight of (or never know) how the software actually works, thus putting themselves at the mercy of predatory companies like Microsoft, which makes it easy (or inevitable) for users to accept at face value the metaphors the corporations spoon feeds them.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=14&annotation=T52LK7Z3)“This call from Hayles and others envisions a leserevolution of code, a moment when code comes to the people.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=14&annotation=GHCWSH75)“At the limits of code studies are, indeed, hardware studies. As Chun points out, "Software cannot be physically separated from hardware, only ideologically" (19). At risk of ignoring "the significance of hardware and extramedial representation," CCS must at times engage” ([Marino, 2012, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=15&annotation=35FXRMIX)“with circuits and microprocessors (18).” ([Marino, 2012, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=15&annotation=YP9F53KV)“However, though my analysis said something about neighborhood hierarchies, it offered little insight on Quicksort itself, nor did it draw from Quicksort a lesson about the society from which it came. My main error was analyzing Quicksort aside from its historical, material, social context.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=15&annotation=PS5K2EZA)“For an algorithm such as Quicksort, the code meets the social realm at the site of its implementation and in the context of the application in which it is used. I was not engaging the cultural origins of Quicksort within the history of computation or even a particular incarnation of Quicksort in a language (I was using pseudocode). Without discussing the human context of the Quicksort code in terms of authorship, use, development, circulation, or operations, I was left with little more than a process” ([Marino, 2012, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=15&annotation=Z7C6EA4T)“Interpretation requires reading an object in its (post)human context through a particular critical lens. This context involves human machines operating in actor-networks. Thus, a simple looping subroutine, say, might remind one of the eternal return of the repressed, but unless that metaphor has significance with respect to the particular, material context of the script itself, the interpretation is not very significant.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=15&annotation=AF6C4LUT)“Thus, while these computer programs are quite meaningful, they will only yield their meaning to the extent to which we interrogate their material and social-historical context to elucidate some aspect of our cultures.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N4DN5TRL?page=15&annotation=ZRN4VSRN)“Cultural critics often speak abstractly of coding practices or the processes of code without getting to the code itself. My emphasis, however, should not understate the need for interpreting these structures with an eye towards fundamental human concerns, concerning race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality; concerning the military-industrial-entertainment and academic complex; concerning surveillance and control over electronic systems-to name but a few.” ([Marino, 2012, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/RYN6RPU2))
