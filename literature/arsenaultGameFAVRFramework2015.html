        <em>The Game FAVR: A Framework for the Analysis of Visual
        Representation in Video Games</em>.</p>
        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>This paper lays out a unified framework of the ergodic
        animage, the rule-based and interactiondriven part of visual
        representation in video games. It is the end product of a
        three-year research project conducted by the INTEGRAE team, and
        is divided into three parts. Part 1 contextualizes the research
        on graphics and visuality within game studies, notably through
        the opposition between fiction and rules and the difficulties in
        finding common vocabulary to discuss key visual concepts such as
        perspective and point of view. Part 2 discusses a number of
        visual traditions through which we frame video game graphics
        (film, animation, art history, graphical projection and
        technical drawing), highlighting their relevance and
        shortcomings in addressing the long history of video games and
        the very different paradigms of 2D and 3D graphics. Part 3
        presents the Game FAVR, a model that allows any game’s visual
        representation to be described and discussed through a common
        frame and vocabulary. The framework is presented in an
        accessible manner and is organized as a toolkit, with sample
        case studies, templates, and a flowchart for using the FAVR
        provided as an annex1, so that researchers and students can
        immediately start using it.</p>

        <p>The paper tries to develop it’s own framework on addressing
        visuality of video games, the problem being, that the common
        terms up to this point were lent from other media and might not
        be able to encompass what makes games games.</p>
        <p>There are three parts in this paper</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>The study of graphics in games studies</li>
        <li>Traditions of visuality in studying video game graphics</li>

        <p>Others how did similar, but usually had very broad aims,
        trying to encompass all the different aspects of video
        games.</p>

        <p>FAVR instead concentrates only on the visual aspects. It
        addresses four problems. A unified framework…</p>

        <li>…should be able to deal with any video game, no matter the
        diversity of aspects it might contain</li>
        <li>…needs to clear terminological confusion, being able to
        address the interesting, novel or banal features of a game</li>
        <li>…needs to account for the different types and styles of
        video game graphics</li>
        <li>…should use a accessible vocabulary that also enables the
        integration of future developments</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Within M. Nitsche’s model of analytical planes, FAVR is
        concerned mainly with the mediated one. It is mainly interested
        in the interactive parts of visuality.</p>

        through Film Studies</h2>
        <p>The paper goes into how a film studies vocabulary was applied
        to analyse and describe video games. That was partially working
        but in many more cases, isn’t adequate. The authors then point
        towards animetism as a better working approach to describe video
        game graphics. It does account for 2d and 3d modes.</p>

        understand video games for two converging reasons: the
        importance of materials, and the composite nature of the image.”

        al., 2015, p. 98</a>)</p>
        <p>The point towards materials is interesting. Composition
        points towards the layered mode of animation, in 2d as well as
        3d. Things are put on top of each other, iE a character on top
        of a background. It also points towards the mixed us of
        material, iE photos and pixelgraphics.</p>
