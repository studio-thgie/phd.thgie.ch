        <p>“Critical Code Studies (CCS) names a set of methodologies for
        the exploration of computer source code using the hermeneutics
        of the humanities. Like 10 PRINT CHR$ (205.5 + RND (1)); : GOTO
        10, Mark Marino’s Critical Code Studies treats code not as
        merely functional but as a text, one that can be read, and
        misinterpreted, by non-programmers. As the author notes,
        code’s”meaning is not determined entirely by the programmer’s
        intention but also by how it is received and recirculated. That
        is not to argue that code can be taken out of context or that
        code means whatever people say it means but rather that the
        meaning of code is contingent and that code is subject to the
        rhetorical triad of speaker, audience (both human and machine),
        and message.” It is time to develop methods of tracing the
        meaning of code. Computer source code has become part of our
        political, legal, aesthetic, and popular discourse. Code is
        being read by lawyers, corporate managers, artists, pundits,
        reporters, and even literary scholars. Code is being used in
        political debate, in artistic exhibitions, in popular
        entertainment, and in historical accounts. As code reaches more
        and more readers and as programming languages and methods
        continue to evolve, we need to develop methods to account for
        the way code accrues meaning and how the readers and shifting
        contexts shape that meaning. We need to learn not only to
        understand the functioning of code but the way code signifies.
        We need to learn to read code critically. Critical Code Studies
        offers a CCS “starting kit,” a set of techniques that scholars
        and other interested parties can use to interpret code in a
        non-computational context”– Provided by publisher</p>
