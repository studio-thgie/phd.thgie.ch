        consistent with contemporary scholarly approaches in media
        studies and media history, typically captured under the umbrella
        of ‚Äúmedia archaeology‚Äù: the materialist and archaeological turns
        which privilege non-progressive history, analysis of failed and
        dead media, and strong attention to technological materiality
        and medium specificity (rather than a representational or
        screen-based focus). ‚Äî <a

        <li><p>While many of the most provocative and innovative
        materialist media theories attempt to productively short circuit
        the subject-object division by displaying how media are active
        agents in the world, these efforts often wind up simply
        rearranging actor-network deck chairs, envisioning histories and
        theories without corporeal or discursive bodies, histories or
        theories lost in their own love for the mechanism‚Äôs indifference
        to the body (which is to say, what makes the virus interesting
        to media archaeology is that it chews up your hard drive
        regardless of your subject position). ‚Äî <a

        <li><p>Insofar as videogame history struggles to represent
        itself as much more than a chronology of consoles, games, and
        programmers, the field fails to critically inquire into the ways
        gender is an infrastructure that profoundly affects who has
        access to what kinds of historical possibilities at a specific
        moment in time and space [4]. Gender dynamics in relationship to
        technological practices must address how spatial politics,
        technological and educational access, and social formations set
        conditions for who might find themselves available to games as a
        medium to begin with [5]. Because game history is largely
        concerned with its chronology of objects, and because even
        Huhtamo‚Äôs archaeological widening is primarily concerned with
        adding objects to find ‚Äúroots‚Äù yet to be ‚Äúexcavated,‚Äù these
        methods do not have a broad or embedded sense of what else
        ‚Äúmight count‚Äù as part of such history. The question of
        rigorously exploring gender as a historical category within game
        studies deserves better than a merely additive or contextual
        move of ‚Äúdigging up‚Äù a history of women and games [6]. Thus, I
        depart significantly from other academic game historians, and
        admittedly operate contra to what one might imagine a feminist
        videogame history to look like. History is not in what we talk
        about, but in how we organize its meaning. ‚Äî <a

        <li><p>Follow me, then. I will offer three scenes dropped out of
        time, three objects: a pedestal, a table, a love letter. They
        will each provide a path for encountering a question: what
        counts in game history? How do bodies come to count in game
        history? How do spaces come to count in game history? How do
        memories come to count in game history? Against each, I will
        parcel out a reading of Roberta Williams; their assemblage will
        carve out conditions of infrastructure and historical
        embeddedness that I could never twine together on a timeline. If
        this seems a strange tableau, consider: it may be their
        discontinuity that shapes a constellation new to the historical
        night. ‚Äî <a

        <li><p>Videogame history does not know how to ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù of
        Roberta Williams except to single her out. Hers is a body deeply
        out of joint in a historical narrative that traditionally
        locates its origins in the male-dominated camaraderie formed
        across subculturally ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù practices of tabletop gaming,
        hacking and coding, and technical mastery. ‚Äî <a

        <li><p>Sierra On-Line was one of the longest standing,
        consistently successful home computer game software companies of
        the 1980s and 1990s, and that Williams herself was the first
        female game designer producing solely for the microcomputer
        market [9]. She was the lead designer of the first adventure
        games with both monochrome and color graphics (Mystery House and
        Wizard and the Princess, respectively, both 1980), the largest
        adventure game ever made during the era (Time Zone, 1982, on six
        double-sided 5.25‚Äù disks), the first ‚Äúadventurization‚Äù of a
        major motion picture (The Dark Crystal, 1983), the first
        adventure game with environmental ‚Äú2.5-D‚Äù depth in which you
        could walk around objects (King‚Äôs Quest, 1984), the first major
        graphical computer game with a recognizably human female avatar
        [10] (King‚Äôs Quest IV, 1988), and the first game to use live
        action actors (Phantasmagoria, 1995). ‚Äî <a

        <li><p>In other words, there has always been more girls to game

        <li><p>Some of her later works, we know, were designed on the
        backs of unrolled wrapping paper, or handwritten on legal pads.
        The table would have been the most obvious surface in the
        Williams‚Äô home large enough to map on, and in most suburban
        tract houses, especially those of the California ranch style,
        layouts were such that kitchens gave the optimal domestic
        observation ‚Äì a mother could ‚Äúwork‚Äù in a kitchen and still
        observe the play of her children in another ‚Äúroom‚Äù of the home.

        <li><p>The imagination of Mystery House rests in neither the
        treasure nor the murders, but in what extends the space of the
        home; how everyday objects like butter knives and pitchers of
        water allow one to traverse the flesh of walls. While most
        games, up to that historical moment, posited their ludic
        experiences in visions of outer space, fields of physical play,
        or fantasy caves and dungeons, Mystery House does not share the
        genealogical investments in space and military research,
        tabletop gaming, and science fiction enthusiasm that concretized
        male affinities, affects, and practices around gamemaking. ‚Äî <a

        <li><p>Notions of designing ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù for Roberta Williams
        were implicitly co-relational to a domestic ‚Äúlabor‚Äù of cooking,
        cleaning, and family maintenance. Furthermore, we cannot imagine
        such space as a ‚Äúfixed‚Äù context into which fall ‚Äústable‚Äù
        technologies and ‚Äúknown‚Äù bodies. ‚Äî <a

        <li>Annotation: Were does this notion actually come from?</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Juul affirms that gameplay has long been more diverse
        than we can easily account for, yet the writing of game history
        as remembered also plays a role beyond Juul‚Äôs scope. Is the
        weird historical trick here that what we have written thus far
        are not histories of gaming but a history of gamers ‚Äì and that
        is why so much gets left out? The curious lives of Roberta
        Williams, of Elizabeth Hood, of the women who make confessions
        of their ludic pasts to me at conferences, suggest that we may
        need to flip the sentence: what does it take for a life to fit a
        game? Within game history, the only people we have made
        historically visible are those we have organized ourselves to
        see, those who have made the game a certain type of culture. But
        there have been others. In the case of my colleague in Denmark,
        she forgot. In the case of that student, she went back to books.
        In the case of Roberta Williams, she gave up game design in 1998
        and has refused interviews for nearly a decade, always, always
        riffing to the same refrain: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do Sierra anymore.‚Äù In the
        case of myself, I stand around, trying to feel out a history not
        of gamers past, but of bodies that mostly remain un-subject to
        our history. ‚Äî <a
