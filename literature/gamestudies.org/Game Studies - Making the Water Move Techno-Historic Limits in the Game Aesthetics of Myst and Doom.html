        <li><p>This paper proposes that the technical limitations at the
        time of a game’s creation have an enormous impact on the overall
        aesthetic of any specific game, and also the traditions of the
        whole craft. — <a

        <li><p>Drawing collectively from these ideas, this paper defines
        “game aesthetics” as the combination of the audio-visual
        rendering aspects and gameplay and narrative/fictional aspects
        of a game experience. This linking of the “audio-visual” (and
        other sensory) rendering with the “gameplay” explicitly
        highlights the important co-dependence that this essay proposes.

        <li><p>Myst and Doom quickly became iconic of two completely
        opposed game forms, with regard to their content, gameplay, over
        all audio-visual aesthetic and demographic of players (Wolf and
        Perron, 2003, p.6). This is ironic given that, had the design
        teams had their way, Doom and Myst would have been
        audio-visually very, very similar indeed. — <a

        <li><p>The cause of the difference between the audio-visual
        aesthetic of Myst and Doom is a pragmatic one, imposed by a
        limitation in technology. Doom did not have cartoon style
        characters due to a lack of imagination or technical skill on
        the part of the designers at id Software. Myst did not have
        still images because Cyan’s designers were limited in their
        vision and ambition. Both companies solved the enormous
        technical limitations of the early 1990s in order to make their
        virtual worlds manifest as best was possible at the time
        (Halifax, 2002) (Miller, 2002). — <a

        <ul>
        <li>Annotation: Could it be argued, that historic-technological
        limits are always in place? As well as in the present, and we’d
        need to remove the historic then, but the premises are the
        same?</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>A good illustration of the increase in computer capacity
        between 1993 and 2008 (and the resulting sophistication of the
        audio-visual rendering) is that the original demo for Doom is
        only 2.3 Megabyte. The 2004 remake of Doom, titled Doom 3, has a
        downloadable demo of 460 Megabytes. Another measure of the
        difference is that Doom contained only 54,000 lines of code,
        while Doom 3 has 785,000 (Kent, 2004). — <a

        </ul></li>
        <li><p>However, in what is possibly Myst’s greatest aesthetic
        achievement, the creators of Myst used the original designed
        intention of CD technology (to stream audio files) to overcome
        this visual stillness (Fargo, 2003; Miller, 2002). The visual
        gaps are filled in with a continuous soundscape — <a

        <li>Annotation: A beautiful example of creative usage of tech to
        work with an aesthetic “problem” that was caused by tech</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Some industry observers characterised Myst’s non violent,
        story based puzzle solving adventures as “an antiquated style of
        gaming” — <a

        <ul>
        <li>Annotation: Now that’s an interesting take, that I would
        love to see rooted in it’s historic context</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>If the image and sound rendering of games reach a
        plateau, what will become of the other component of this essay’s
        loose definition of “game aesthetics”, the gameplay and
        narrative/fictional aspects? What technical and craft
        limitations and opportunities might present themselves? — <a

        <li><p>The success of the earliest, crudest forms of Myst and
        Doom reveals the truth that all forms of audio-visual rendering,
        including text and photographic images, depend on a
        sensationally sophisticated technique of finally smoothing out
        all of their technical limitations. That technique is, of
        course, the individual human’s capacity to fully rendering it in
        their own imaginations (Miller, 1997) — <a

        <ul>
        <li>Annotation: Offloading technological deficiency into the
        human by processes of approximation.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>However, this “more powerful representation” only remains
        more powerful until the human eye sees something more
        sophisticatedly rendered (Darley, 2000, p.28). The games Myst
        and realMyst demonstrate this effect particularly well, since
        the two titles are actually the same gameplay/narrative/world —

        <ul>
        <li>Annotation: Nonetheless, the opposite can be true as well,
        or so I believe. Sometimes, re-issues of games trigger strong
        responses of disliking and favouring the original graphics.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Both the producers and the consumers of games expect each
        version to be audio-visually bigger, richer, smoother, and so
        forth (Magal in Valve, 2004 p.63). — <a

        <ul>
        <li>Annotation: Generalized as such, I can’t argue with it
        :)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Of course, the value of this use of RI in games has been
        convincingly demonstrated by the success of several MMORPG
        (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) titles, of
        which Everquest (Verant, 1999), Ultima On-line (Origin, 1997)
        and World of Warcraft (Blizzard, 2004) are now classic examples.
        It is important to recognise that these games have a clear
        lineage back through text-only online MUDs (multi-user dungeon),
        and then back to non digitally mediated, face-to-face
        roleplaying games, where RI systems were/are the norm for
        example: Dungeons &amp; Dragons (Gygax and Andersen, 1974). — <a

        <li>Annotation: That is an interesting backtrace!</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Richer media do have the potential to actually carry more
        information, and therefore to convey more meaning for
        dramatic/narrative/immersive/gameplay effect, even if game
        designers are not yet fully using this potential. — <a
