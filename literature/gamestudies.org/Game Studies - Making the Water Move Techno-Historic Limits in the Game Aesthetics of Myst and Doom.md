## Page Notes
## Highlights
- This paper proposes that the technical limitations at the time of a game’s creation have an enormous impact on the overall aesthetic of any specific game, and also the traditions of the whole craft. — [Updated on 2022-11-19 10:57:30](https://hyp.is/lJo2bGfwEe22ZftI6ttptg/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public

- Drawing collectively from these ideas, this paper defines “game aesthetics” as the combination of the audio-visual rendering aspects and gameplay and narrative/fictional aspects of a game experience. This linking of the “audio-visual” (and other sensory) rendering with the “gameplay” explicitly highlights the important co-dependence that this essay proposes. — [Updated on 2022-11-19 11:05:37](https://hyp.is/tvB6DmfxEe2TyM_zqfCytA/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public

- Myst and Doom quickly became iconic of two completely opposed game forms, with regard to their content, gameplay, over all audio-visual aesthetic and demographic of players (Wolf and Perron, 2003, p.6). This is ironic given that, had the design teams had their way, Doom and Myst would have been audio-visually very, very similar indeed.  — [Updated on 2022-11-19 11:21:36](https://hyp.is/8vtC1GfzEe2bMeeO_2I6nw/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public

- The cause of the difference between the audio-visual aesthetic of Myst and Doom is a pragmatic one, imposed by a limitation in technology. Doom did not have cartoon style characters due to a lack of imagination or technical skill on the part of the designers at id Software. Myst did not have still images because Cyan’s designers were limited in their vision and ambition. Both companies solved the enormous technical limitations of the early 1990s in order to make their virtual worlds manifest as best was possible at the time (Halifax, 2002) (Miller, 2002). — [Updated on 2022-11-19 13:23:12](https://hyp.is/77ltnGgEEe2USS-bBR27JA/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Could it be argued, that historic-technological limits are always in place? As well as in the present, and we'd need to remove the historic then, but the premises are the same?
- A good illustration of the increase in computer capacity between 1993 and 2008 (and the resulting sophistication of the audio-visual rendering) is that the original demo for Doom is only 2.3 Megabyte. The 2004 remake of Doom, titled Doom 3, has a downloadable demo of 460 Megabytes. Another measure of the difference is that Doom contained only 54,000 lines of code, while Doom 3 has 785,000 (Kent, 2004). — [Updated on 2022-11-19 13:24:38](https://hyp.is/IpHuLmgFEe2N6ruTvoZ2UA/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Measuring technological complexity
- However, in what is possibly Myst’s greatest aesthetic achievement, the creators of Myst used the original designed intention of CD technology (to stream audio files) to overcome this visual stillness (Fargo, 2003; Miller, 2002). The visual gaps are filled in with a continuous soundscape — [Updated on 2022-11-19 16:34:41](https://hyp.is/r5xOimgfEe2qcuskFKTA_Q/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: A beautiful example of creative usage of tech to work with an aesthetic "problem" that was caused by tech
- Some industry observers characterised Myst’s non violent, story based puzzle solving adventures as “an antiquated style of gaming" — [Updated on 2022-11-19 16:36:55](https://hyp.is/_41USGgfEe2qdQ8hfZWh0A/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Now that's an interesting take, that I would love to see rooted in it's historic context
- If the image and sound rendering of games reach a plateau, what will become of the other component of this essay’s loose definition of “game aesthetics”, the gameplay and narrative/fictional aspects? What technical and craft limitations and opportunities might present themselves? — [Updated on 2022-11-19 16:37:51](https://hyp.is/IHo0UGggEe2HkiMeds5VSQ/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public

- The success of the earliest, crudest forms of Myst and Doom reveals the truth that all forms of audio-visual rendering, including text and photographic images, depend on a sensationally sophisticated technique of finally smoothing out all of their technical limitations. That technique is, of course, the individual human’s capacity to fully rendering it in their own imaginations (Miller, 1997) — [Updated on 2022-11-19 16:45:11](https://hyp.is/Jy54yGghEe2oIw-giuj_jg/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Offloading technological deficiency into the human by processes of approximation.
- However, this “more powerful representation” only remains more powerful until the human eye sees something more sophisticatedly rendered (Darley, 2000, p.28). The games Myst and realMyst demonstrate this effect particularly well, since the two titles are actually the same gameplay/narrative/world — [Updated on 2022-11-19 16:48:35](https://hyp.is/oE-OzGghEe2uhc9-QmjWTg/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Nonetheless, the opposite can be true as well, or so I believe. Sometimes, re-issues of games trigger strong responses of disliking and favouring the original graphics.
- Both the producers and the consumers of games expect each version to be audio-visually bigger, richer, smoother, and so forth (Magal in Valve, 2004 p.63). — [Updated on 2022-11-19 16:50:25](https://hyp.is/4mYjUmghEe2uhof1w39PGA/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Generalized as such, I can't argue with it :)
- Of course, the value of this use of RI in games has been convincingly demonstrated by the success of several MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) titles, of which Everquest (Verant, 1999), Ultima On-line (Origin, 1997) and World of Warcraft (Blizzard, 2004) are now classic examples. It is important to recognise that these games have a clear lineage back through text-only online MUDs (multi-user dungeon), and then back to non digitally mediated, face-to-face roleplaying games, where RI systems were/are the norm for example: Dungeons & Dragons (Gygax and Andersen, 1974).  — [Updated on 2022-11-19 17:07:11](https://hyp.is/Oe7xdGgkEe29UTfBk-zqLA/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: That is an interesting backtrace!
- Richer media do have the potential to actually carry more information, and therefore to convey more meaning for dramatic/narrative/immersive/gameplay effect, even if game designers are not yet fully using this potential.  — [Updated on 2022-11-19 17:11:34](https://hyp.is/1leOLGgkEe2rvn-Rv6zvAQ/gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) — Group: #Public
