Willumsen, E. C. (2016). _Source Code and Formal Analysis: A Hermeneutic Reading of Passage_. [http://www.digra.org/digital-library/publications/source-code-and-formal-analysis-a-hermeneutic-reading-of-passage/](http://www.digra.org/digital-library/publications/source-code-and-formal-analysis-a-hermeneutic-reading-of-passage/)
## Abstract
White-box analysis of video games is not an integrated part of the formal analysis. Rather, few scholars have investigated how an analysis of the source code can inform a hermeneutic reading of the game. In this paper I will present a reading of the source code of Passage (Rohrer, 2007), argue for why a focus on authorial intention is unnecessary when investigating the symbolism and metaphors of a game, and illustrate how the whitebox analysis can inform the formal analysis of the executed game. Finally, I shall discuss how the source code relates to the game as a ‘work’, and how it can be used for studies of symbolism and metaphors. Thus I will conclude that it is indeed a valuable method for game studies, albeit needing more studies on the textual relation between executed game and source code.
## Notes
> **White-box testing** (also known as **clear box testing**, **glass box testing**, **transparent box testing**, and **structural testing**) is a method of [software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing "Software testing") that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. [black-box testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing "Black-box testing")).

- white-box testing is a necessary part of a _complete_ analysis of a game, but not necessarily a necessary one
- only few have attempted to do a hermeneutic reading of a game’s source code and most of them based their analysis on a notion of internationality and authorship
- these notions of authorial intent have been critiqued as a fallacy

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/6T2RWZGL?page=2&annotation=8EZGHA2J) “if the game manages to communicate what the author intended, there should be no need for studying this intention. If the game fails in doing so, the researcher must go outside the game” ([Willumsen, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/6SIBNJWL))

- in games it is often not possible to pinpoint a single author (even less so a nationality)

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/6T2RWZGL?page=3&annotation=YTCXR2VR) “If the author can’t be defined, one cannot talk about authorial intent as such.” ([Willumsen, 2016, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/6SIBNJWL))

- the death of the author (barthes) is mentioned, a discourse I might have to look at. Foucault also says, one should rather concentrate on the work, on not its relationship with its author.
- see also [intentional fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorial_intent#New_Criticism) on this discourse, but I see that this is still heavily debated.
- the author intents to show that source code can be interpreted without authorial paratexts, and avoid intentional fallacy
- there is a large chunk of highly relevant writting that I’ll just include here

My argument is that much meaning can be interpreted from the code itself, and that much of this meaning may not be immediately evident in the executed game. As such, some of the things that are usually interpreted on an abstract and symbolic level in the traditional game analysis will be hardcoded into the game’s source code through naming. I believe that this allows us to disregard author statements and other secondary sources in which the programmers and/or creators express their intent and meaning of the game, and instead uncover this meaning simply through an analysis of the code.” ([Willumsen, 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/6SIBNJWL))

The few lines that are useful for the analysis have been found by playing through the game, interpreting symbolism and metaphors, and returning to the code to see if any of this is spelled out in the code.” ([Willumsen, 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/6SIBNJWL))

- those two paragraphs point to method and how to approach cirtical code analysis in video games research
- the naming of variables and functions  offers clear pointer to things that might be ambiguous in the executed game (ie the player becoming a gravestone, meaning death, but in the sourcecode it is clearly written that the player is dead)
- reading gender and relationship stereotyping form source code!

-

1. reading into the source code can add to understand metaphors and symbols that are ambiguous. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4724071/items/6T2RWZGL?page=8&annotation=L7DII2GL) “Moreover, it enforces a focus on games as second order design – that which is designed by an author is not the executed game but the source code.” ([Willumsen, 2016, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/6SIBNJWL))
2. reading structures that are present but not visible in the game

- source code is a different “text” then the executed game; it can be several hypo- or paratexts (code, comments) to the main text, the executed game
- lol, fml:

- leaving with an open question on authorship in video games

“Moreover, in order to justify how white-box analysis can avoid the intentional fallacy, we must study in depth whether game designers and programmers can be understood as heuristic authors, whether we have to accept the author as an individual, at least for cases where the game is made by one person, or if there is a third, advantageous way of conceptualizing (the) author(s) of video games.” ([Willumsen, 2016, p. 9](zotero://select/groups/4724071/items/6SIBNJWL))

## Annotations
> One of the first scholars to point out the relevance of a reading of the code of a game is Konzack (2002), who in his otherwise very humanities focused seven layer analysis model includes both hardware and program code. He argues that “[i]n a complete analysis of a computer game every layer of the computer game in question should be analysed, but it is still possible to make an analysis of a computer game with out [sic] taking every layer into account”(Konzack, 2002, p. 92). (p. 1)

> I wish to illustrate that it is possible to conduct a hermeneutic reading of the source code, which is studied in relation to the executed game, without having to dive deep into algorithms or understand complicated syntax. Quite on the contrary, it should be possible for most game scholars who have just a little experience of reading or writing code to gain valuable insights from the analysis of the source code from the game in question. (p. 2)

> One thing existing applications have in common is their focus on authorial intent, which I will argue does not have to be an inherent part of white-box analysis in the context of game studies. (p. 2)

> if the game manages to communicate what the author intended, there should be no need for studying this intention. If the game fails in doing so, the researcher must go outside the game (p. 2)

> Who is to encode the game object with meaning, and who can then serve as “evidence” when investigating a potentially failed implementation of this meaning? (p. 3)

> If the author can’t be defined, one cannot talk about authorial intent as such. (p. 3)

> This sort of focus on intent is old-fashioned and has been abandoned in most fields quite a while ago. One can therefore wonder why it is still the dominant mode within white-box analysis in game studies. (p. 3)

> The aim is now to illustrate that similar interpretations can be made from a reading of the source code, rather than based on the creator statement. As such, the goal is to eliminate the notion of authorial intent in the analysis, and thereby not studying Rohrer’s creator statement as a paratext. (p. 4)

> Naming can be seen as a part of the code aesthetics, and can therefore be studied in relation to program comprehension, however in the following analysis, I will search to make sense of method and variable names as parts of a formal analysis of video games. My argument is that much meaning can be interpreted from the code itself, and that much of this meaning may not be immediately evident in the executed game. As such, some of the things that are usually interpreted on an abstract and symbolic level in the traditional game analysis will be hardcoded into the game’s source code through naming. I believe that this allows us to disregard author statements and other secondary sources in which the programmers and/or creators express their intent and meaning of the game, and instead uncover this meaning simply through an analysis of the code. (p. 5)

> As with any other game example, large parts of Passage’s code are not relevant for this investigation. The few lines that are useful for the analysis have been found by playing through the game, interpreting symbolism and metaphors, and returning to the code to see if any of this is spelled out in the code. (p. 5)

> What we as players interpret from the symbolism of the gravestone as death of the avatar is clearly written in the script as death of the player, which will make the avatar stop moving. As such, this case serves as an example of how code reading in the analysis can support arguments of interpretations. It also illustrates a strong relationship between player and avatar, which could be interpreted as if there is no character in the game, but only an avatar which is meant as a graphical representation of the player and is not articulated as a manifestation of Rohrer himself. (p. 6)

> The code in fig. 3 shows that the player can only ever have one spouse during a playthrough, as the heart animation, which functions as a ‘pick-up’ of the spouse, is only generated if the player has not yet met the spouse, the spouse is not dead, and the spouse is not next to the player (that is, the spouse is not currently active). This is never commented upon in the creator statement, but can indeed inform the formal analysis of the game, as monogamous, heteronormative standards are hardcoded into the game. (p. 7)

> 1) cases in which the specific variable or method name reveals information about the game artifact and its potential representations on the interface, and 2) examples that show how specific implementations of procedures establish rules in the game that cannot necessarily be seen in the executed game. (p. 8)

> Moreover, it enforces a focus on games as second order design – that which is designed by an author is not the executed game but the source code. (p. 8)

> The Foucauldian meaning of the ‘work’ emphasizes an analysis of its structure, architecture, intrinsic form, and internal relationships, rather than of its relationship to the author (Foucault, 1969). (p. 8)

> However, the source code is not the executed game object. We have to accept that we are, when conducting white-box analysis as a part of a formal game analysis, working with different texts. The executed game can be seen as the main text, whereas the source code can take on the role as another text related to the main text, e.g. as a hypotext or paratext, or potentially as several texts, as the source code consists of respectively code and comments which may be understood as separate texts. (p. 8)

> Neither hypotext, cybertext, nor paratext may be the right ways to make sense of the relationship between the game and its code, and hence what status the source code should have in the formal analysis. (p. 9)

> Moreover, in order to justify how white-box analysis can avoid the intentional fallacy, we must study in depth whether game designers and programmers can be understood as heuristic authors, whether we have to accept the author as an individual, at least for cases where the game is made by one person, or if there is a third, (p. 9)
