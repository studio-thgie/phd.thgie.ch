## Abstract
This paper lays out a unified framework of the ergodic animage, the rule-based and interactiondriven part of visual representation in video games. It is the end product of a three-year research project conducted by the INTEGRAE team, and is divided into three parts. Part 1 contextualizes the research on graphics and visuality within game studies, notably through the opposition between fiction and rules and the difficulties in finding common vocabulary to discuss key visual concepts such as perspective and point of view. Part 2 discusses a number of visual traditions through which we frame video game graphics (film, animation, art history, graphical projection and technical drawing), highlighting their relevance and shortcomings in addressing the long history of video games and the very different paradigms of 2D and 3D graphics. Part 3 presents the Game FAVR, a model that allows any game’s visual representation to be described and discussed through a common frame and vocabulary. The framework is presented in an accessible manner and is organized as a toolkit, with sample case studies, templates, and a flowchart for using the FAVR provided as an annex1, so that researchers and students can immediately start using it.

## Notes

The paper tries to develop it’s own framework on addressing visuality of video games, the problem being, that the common terms up to this point were lent from other media and might not be able to encompass what makes games games.

Others how did similar, but usually had very broad aims, trying to encompass all the different aspects of video games.

FAVR instead concentrates only on the visual aspects. It addresses four problems. A unified framework…

1.  …should be able to deal with any video game, no matter the diversity of aspects it might contain
2.  …needs to clear terminological confusion, being able to address the interesting, novel or banal features of a game
3.  …needs to account for the different types and styles of video game graphics
4.  …should use a accessible vocabulary that also enables the integration of future developments

Within M. Nitsche’s model of analytical planes, FAVR is concerned mainly with the mediated one. It is mainly interested in the interactive parts of visuality.

This is probably a fun point to discuss with my fellow researchers.

### Ergodic Animage

The paper [Making the Water Move](http://gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch) also references ergodicity.

There we go… the materiality of the visual material of video games:
