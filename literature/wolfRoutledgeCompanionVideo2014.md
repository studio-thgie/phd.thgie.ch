## Abstract
"The number of publications dealing with video game studies has exploded over the course of the last decade, but the field has not yet produced a comprehensive reference work. The Routledge Companion to Video Game Studies, by well-known video game scholars Mark Wolf and Bernard Perron, aims to address the on-going theoretical and methodological development of game studies, providing students, scholars, and game designers with a definitive look at contemporary video game studies. Features include: -comprehensive and interdisciplinary models and approaches for analyzing video games; -new perspectives on video games both as art form and cultural phenomenon; -explorations of technical and creative dimensions of video games; -accounts of the economical, political, social, and cultural dynamics of video games"--

## Emulation

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65H72L3G?page=49&annotation=6RKFHKZC)“An emulator is an application that tries to mimic another system in order to run applications the way they were run on their original system. It” ([“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/L8CTY6WF))

Where as “Virtualization **relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system**.” (VMWare)

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65H72L3G?page=49&annotation=CK4SDR9K)“emulators can only load an image of the game and do not necessarily preserve accurately other aspects of the game itself: its graphical aspects, sound precision, controllers, and original playing context.” ([“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/L8CTY6WF))

That said, it is sometimes/often the only way to have access to the actual game, while also changing the gameplay experience actively.

### Some notes on faithful rendition of games

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65H72L3G?page=50&annotation=ERCUIR6K)“But emulation changes the gaming experience in different ways, whether because of the player’s hardware or the emulator’s lack of precision itself. For instance, different screens render graphics in different ways. A 1980s NTSC TV set is not as precise as a 2010s DEL screen. The cathode-ray tubes of home TV sets and arcade cabinets give a blurry quality to the graphics that masks “imperfections” in the final render (Therrien, 2012, p. 15). In terms of preservation, a sharp-edged pixel is not faithful to what a common player experienced in the 1980s. Even pixel aspect ratios are different from one screen type to another. Moreover, the GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin can upscale the original resolution up to 1080p, which of course is not faithful to the original conception.” ([“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/L8CTY6WF))

It would be interesting to know, how this changes the experience of a game.

For those behind the MAME project, playing the game is considered merely a “nice side effect” (MAME, n.d.) from their objectives. Sure, you have to actually play the games to see if the emulation worked; but making games easily playable (on a modern PC) is not a specific goal they pursue.” ([“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/L8CTY6WF))

That playability could not be the main goal didn’t occur to me…

Since it is difficult to render, it will not show up with a common emulator (ZSnes or Snes9X, for example)—and the typical player will not know that it should have been there.” ([“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 51](zotero://select/library/items/L8CTY6WF))

This changes a lot!

You will never know if an obscure game you load within an emulator is correctly rendered, if you don’t have the real functionality of the original hardware.” ([“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 51](zotero://select/library/items/L8CTY6WF))

### Some notes on contextualizing gameplay

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65H72L3G?page=51&annotation=EBYQ6KZY)“Even the simple ambience of a console in a 1980s living room on a small TV set is not the same as a researcher’s office computer screen.” ([“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 51](zotero://select/library/items/L8CTY6WF))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65H72L3G?page=51&annotation=BG4LZYM9)“Emulation can’t revive MUDs (multi-user dimensions) or MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing games) communities when they disappear.” ([“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 51](zotero://select/library/items/L8CTY6WF))

### Accessibility

Although emulation is though of giving access to old games, it can be quite daunting and difficult to create the right setup to play a game. Given you’ll have the game files and are ready to dabble in some legal grey zone.

### A new Layer of Contextualization

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65H72L3G?page=53&annotation=29EEK78Y)“Emulation is not a preservation of every aspect of an apparatus, but it is still a convenient and accessible way to have an experience analogous to the one on the original system. This “second-hand” experience requires scholars to be aware of the technical and cultural differences between the two systems.” ([“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 53](zotero://select/library/items/L8CTY6WF))

Conclusion: Emulation can make gameplay accessible, but it will also change it. It is thus important to be reflective of that and to contextualize it and not use it as the sole source of analyzing a game.
