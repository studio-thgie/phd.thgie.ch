## Abstract
In-Game Photographien oder Screenshots sind im weitesten Sinne Momentabbildungen von digitalen Welten, wahrgenommen über einen Bildschirm. In dieser Arbeit soll gezeigt werden, wie diese Form von Bilderzeugung in Bezug auf die künstlerische Kreation, virtuelle sowie reale Welt und auf die Photographie zu verorten ist.

-   2.1 Game studies as defined by Aarseth, Juul, Sachs-Hombach, Thon
-   game studies as by, of and between many disciplines
-   in-game photography as a good example of the three rule-fiction relations by Juul
-   2.2 Videogames as cybertexts
-   cybertexts are a textual category of media; are non-linear, becoming linear through the act of reading

«[W]hen you read from a cybertext, you are constantly reminded of inaccessible strategies and paths not taken, voices not heard. Each decision will make some parts of the text more, and others less, accessible, and you may never know the exact results of your choices; that is, exactly what you missed.» (Aarseth 1997: 3)

I referred to this in my thoughts on the image in video games, and how they are only truly present during play.

-   ergodic is a compound word made of ergon and hodos, work and path
-   2.3 Gameworlds; contain relations between virtual (fictive) worlds and the real world
-   comes from analytical philosophy on possible worlds
-   2.4 Photography / Screenshots
-   After Flusser: photography is real, not the world or the photographic apparatus
-   photographic apparatus is the interface to the world
-   game worlds are not made to tells stories, but to make them experienceable

Videogames are such complex cybertexts, that a player hardly ever experiences or sees the same as any other player. In-game photographer now take a curated snapshot, sometimes far from the path-to-take, and frame it contextually. As such, they are similar to archicture-photographies.

-   3.1 Technologies; on the tools in use
-   3.2 VR Photography Examples
-   3.3 Excursion
-   3.4 Conclusion; in-game photograpy as triangular relation between gameworld, gamespace and physical world; duality between virtual world and rules
