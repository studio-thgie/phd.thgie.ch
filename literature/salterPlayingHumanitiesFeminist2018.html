        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>Both game studies and the broader digital humanities value
        the public scholar: the intersection of games academic spaces
        with games journalism and online communities offers lots of
        valuable opportunities for debate and shared knowledge. However,
        participation within these communities comes at very different
        potential costs for scholars based on their identities, and the
        currency of one network becomes fuel for a witch hunt from
        another. Acting as a public scholar brings with it risk that is
        inherently tied to a scholar’s identity and position: gender,
        race, sexual identity, and other elements of identity not only
        bring intense scrutiny but often</p>

        <p>Being an academic in digital humanities or video game studies
        means being public, as this is a common, almost assumed,
        practice in the fields. That means, opting out is most probably
        not an option. This puts marginalized voices in danger, as they
        are often getting backlashed at, when being public.</p>
        <p><a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FBINQ6JY?page=468&amp;annotation=7I5N4X66">Go
        to annotation</a>“Both games and digital humanities suffer from
        a similar challenge of being adjacent to science, technology,
        engineering, and math (STEM), but not part of the discourse of
        STEM.” (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/Q9PYM3VL">Salter
        and Blodgett, 2018, p. 468</a>)</p>
        <p>What it shares with the tech world, is that marginalized
        voices are often the least amplified. This is furthered by a
        hierarchy of fields, whereas game studies is clearly bellow
        STEM.</p>

        to annotation</a>“Ian Bogost noted, “The truth is, as a critical
        and pedagogical concern, game studies is hardly a powerful
        actor. Games are, I’m sorry to report, a joke that have managed
        nevertheless to eke out a place in the study of arts and
        culture”” (<a

        Blodgett, 2018, p. 468</a>)</p>
        <p>In STEM as in the game industry, more technical fields are
        higher up in the hierarchies and usually male dominated. This
        parallels digital humanities, especially regarding the technical
        barriers to entry and participation.</p>
