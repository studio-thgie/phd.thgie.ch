## Abstract
This paper proposes that the technical limitations at the
time of a game’s creation have an enormous impact on the overall aesthetic of
any specific game, and also the traditions of the whole craft. Thus, an
awareness of this aspect is critical to the useful analysis of games. However,
this is often missing from current analyses of games. To illustrate both the
significance of techno-historic limits, and several fundamental principals of
digital technology, the landmark games Myst
(Cyan, 1993) and Doom (id Software,
1993) are explored as examples of the evolution of game aesthetics over time.
This leads to an examination of the future limits of the rendering of images
and sounds, and how this may have an impact on future game aesthetics and
genres.
