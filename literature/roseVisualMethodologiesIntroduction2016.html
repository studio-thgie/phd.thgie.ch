        <p>“Now in its Fourth Edition, Visual Methodologies: An
        Introduction to Researching with Visual Methodologies is a
        bestselling critical guide to the study and analysis of visual
        culture. Existing chapters have been fully updated to offer a
        rigorous examination and demonstration of an individual
        methodology in a clear and structured style. Reflecting changes
        in the way society consumes and creates its visual content, new
        features include: Brand new chapters dealing with social media
        platforms, the development of digital methods and the modern
        circulation and audiencing of research images. More ‘Focus’
        features covering interactive documentaries, digital
        story-telling and participant mapping. A Companion Website
        featuring links to useful further resources relating to each
        chapter. A now classic text, Visual Methodologies appeals to
        undergraduates, graduates, researchers and academics across the
        social sciences and humanities who are looking to get to grips
        with the complex debates and ideas in visual analysis and
        interpretation”– Publisher</p>

        <p>Images are culture and representation, but also material and
        affective. Vision is our ability to see, whereas visuality or
        scopic regime is how our vision is formed or constructed.
        Ocularcentrism describes our simping for visual culture.
        Simulacra are images detached from a relation to the real
        world.</p>
        <p>Visual economy is about how visual objects travers cultures,
        forcefully or not, meanwhile changing their meanings, contexts,
        affects etc.</p>
        <p>it’s important to reflect on the power relations embedded in
        images and their media, and what they enable us to see or not
        see.</p>
        <p><strong>What do images represent, how do they affect and what
        power relations are they transposing?</strong></p>
        <p>Five important aspects in engaging with visual culture</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>visualising social difference</li>
        <li>how images are looked at</li>
        <li>Differentiating visual cultures</li>
        <li>the circulation of images</li>
        <li>The agency of images</li>
        </ol>
        <p>“an image may have its own visual effects; these effects,
        through the ways of seeing mobilised by the image, are crucial
        in the production and reproduction of visions of social
        difference; but these effects always intersect with the social
        context of viewing, with how the image is circulated, and with
        the visualities spectators bring to their viewing.” p. 22</p>
        <p>a critical approach to interpreting visual images:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>take images seriously</li>
        <li>think amour about the social conditions and effects of
        images and their modes of distribution</li>
        <li> consider your own way of looking at images</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="section-1">2</h2>
        <p>Four sites of thinking about visual material</p>
        <ul>
        <li>production</li>
        <li>content</li>
        <li>circulation</li>
        <li>audiencing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Three modalities of a site</p>
        <ul>
        <li>technological</li>
        <li>compositional</li>
        <li>social (economical, social, political)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notes on figure 2.2: the womanooks at one image that we can’t
        see. She seems to be saying something to a man, even explaining,
        closely standing by. She makes a hand gesture. The man in turn
        looks at a painting of nude woman. In the background, a
        ceinturerie denotes the street is in a french speaking country.
        Three more people can be seen in the slightly blurry background.
        The photograph is black and white and could date back to
        something around 1900 - 1920.</p>
        <p>Images of the same gerne share certain features. It seems
        that genre regarding images is much easier then in game studies.
        Remediation is the referencing of older genre while gestating a
        new one. Images often fit clearly into one genre, while
         relating to others at the same time.</p>
        <p><strong>Auteur theory</strong>: what did the images author
        had in mind at production?</p>
        <p>Compositionality: how the image‘s content is arranged</p>
        <p>Aura: the authority, authenticity and unattainability of an
        umage</p>
        <p>Audiencing: the process of witnessing, renegotiating or
        rejecting the meaning of an image, by particular audiences in
        particular circumstances</p>
        <p>Convergence: from medium-specific visual content to
        transmediality, communication interdependence, many ways of
        accessing media content, melange between top-down corporate comm
        and bottom-up participatory culture</p>
        <h2 id="section-2">3</h2>
        <p>Is about how to read this book. There are three main
        approaches: reading by sites and modalities, by visual material
        at hand, and by relation to other books.</p>
        <h2 id="the-good-eye---compositional-interpretation">4 The Good
        Eye - compositional interpretation</h2>
        <p><em>the image itself, compositional, video games (films and
        fine arts)</em></p>
        <p>The Good Eye involves becoming a <strong>connoisseur</strong>
        of what one is looking at, acquiring a certain expertise.
        Compositional interpretation (CI) needs a lot of context
        information in order to have this expertise at hand. CI does
        neglects the social sites of an image and needs to be paired
        with other methods, such as semiotics or discourse analysis. CI
        is close to phenomenological approaches. <em>It can be a good
        starting point to other, more critical inquiries.</em></p>
        <p>CI can take production into account, if it relates to how the
        image looks like it does.</p>
        <p>Michael Nitsche discusses <strong>functionality</strong> as
        something that influences how a game looks and feels like.
        Looking at the rules that define functionality can be important
        in CI in video games.</p>
        <p>Compositionality is built up from the following
        characteristics</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Content</p>
        <ul>
        <li>take time to make sure you know what you are seeing</li>
        <li>often defines Genre</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Colour</p>
        <ul>
        <li>hue (the actual colour), saturation (its purity) and value
        (light- and darkness)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Spatial organisation</p>
        <ul>
        <li>perspective (geometrical), logic of figuration (position
        offered to a viewer by the image), focalisers (visual
        organisation)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Montage (Film)</p></li>
        <li><p>Sound</p></li>
        <li><p>Light</p></li>
        <li><p>Expressive content</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As of 2016, Gillian Rose knows of only two sampling
        strategies to analyse visual material from video games:
        screenshots and clips, both manually initiated (see chapter 5
        for more on sampling strategies).</p>

        </ul>
        <h2 id="content-and-cultural-analysis">5 Content and cultural
        analysis</h2>
        <p>CCA is about analysis large sets of images through sets of
        rules and procedures concerning selection, coding and
        quantitative analysis.It thus has an inherent relationship to
        mass media, also, originating from that corner of visual
        culture.</p>
        <p>Lev Manovich recently developed an approach called cultural
        analytics. CCA doesn’t necessarily exclude qualitative analysis.
        It enables the researcher to look at visual material at
        different scales, sometimes making out patterns for example.
        Therefor it is important to concentrate on two aspects in
        particular: <strong>replicability and validity</strong>. CCA
        tries to be methodological explizit and reflective by avoiding
        sampling bias. On the downside, CCA focuses mostly on the
        compositional modality of images and says little about
        production and the social.</p>
        <h3 id="stages-of-cca">Stages of CCA</h3>
        <p>This approach is based on counting clearly defined visual
        elements on a clearly defined corpus of images, and then analyse
        the frequency of those elements.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Finding images: the set of images needs to be
        representative towards the research questions</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Sampling strategies include: random, stratified (from
        subsets), systematic (ie interval), cluster (random groups)</li>
        <li>Sampling size depends on variation in the image set; the
        more variation the bigger the set</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Devising your categories for coding</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Codes/categories must be exhaustive, exclusive, enlightening
        (Slater, 1998). They must be developed in relation to their
        theoretical concerns, and must have analytical significance,
        pointing towards the relation between images and cultural
        context. This is the <strong>validity</strong>.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Coding the images</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Codes must be as unambiguous as possible. That should
        theoretically enable different researchers at different times to
        code the same images the same way. This is
        <strong>replicability</strong>. Codes need testing and reworking
        before being put into their final forms, as well as be well
        documented.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Analysing the results</p>
        <ul>
        <li>frequency, relationality to between different codes,
        emerging of themes</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cultural analytics is more software based and works on a more
        compositional level (colors, forms, etc), less on meaning and
        signification.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Numbers do not easily translate into significance.</p>

        id="semiology-social-semiotics---laying-bare-the-prejudices">6
        Semiology (social semiotics) - Laying bare the prejudices</h2>
        <p>…is about how images make meanings. It has close ties to the
        social sciences. One of the most important aspects of semiology
        is … wait for it … the “sign”. It has an elaborate vocabulary
        and sets of categories on how we make sense of images and how
        they produce meaning. Semiology claims to be scientific, through
        unearthing inequalities (as opposed to ideology, which is
        knowledge constructed to hide inequalities). This shows the
        social sciences (Marx) influences on semiology, and hence it is
        concerned with social effects of meaning.</p>
        <p>That said, of late the terminology “ideological complex” is
        used in order to denote that semiological approaches are not
        necessarily objective (Althusserian science) but also a form of
        ideology since they have their own distinct interests and
        resistance against another social group. This approach can lead
        way to more reflectivity in working semiologicly. </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Semiology often focuses on the site of the image itself, as
        the place where meaning resides and has a good look at the
        compositional as well as social modality. </li>
        <li>A good amount of semiologic approaches focus on the social
        modality at the other sites, ie audiencing, giving way to
        <strong>social semiotics</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Social semiotics concentrates on the act of doing meanings,
        instead of the sign/the meaning itself. On the downside,
        semiology is heavily theoretical loaded and uses a distinct
        analytical vocabulary, which makes it a very elaborate and
        work-intensive methodology. </p>

        id="discourse-analysis-1---text-intertextuality-and-context">8
        Discourse Analysis 1 - Text, intertextuality and context</h2>
        <p>Concentrates on how texts are involved in the construction of
        social difference, hence, concentrates on power relations and
        their politics. One of this methods main intellectual is Michel
        Foucault. He saw discourse as a form of discipline, hence the
        focus on power.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>discourse: groups of statements that structure the way a
        thing is thought, and the way we act on the basis of that
        thinking</li>
        <li>intertextuality: the meaning of a text depends on a meaning
        of another text</li>
        <li>discursive formation: how meanings in a particular discourse
        are linked together</li>
        <li>power: is not only applied top down, but is present
        everywhere, as there is discourse everywhere</li>
        <li>power/knowledge constitute each other</li>
        <li>regimes of truth: knowledge is power because it defines what
        is true</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Discourse produces the world as it understands it. Foucault
        said that painting “is discursive practice that is embodied in
        techniques and effects”. That said, he was rejecting
        methodological and theoretical analysis and focused mainly on
        how the power in question works.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>How do images construct accounts of the social world? The
        discourse analyst focus is on the image itself and its social
        modality.</p></li>
        <li><p>“In particular, discourse analysis explores how those
        specific views or accounts are constructed as real or truthful
        or natural through particular regimes of truth”</p></li>
        <li><p>iconography shares some approaches with discourse
        analysis, especially intertextuality: how were symbols and signs
        understood by their contemporary audience. Panofsky
        differentiated three ways of interpretation.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>primary, natural, pre-iconographic</li>
        <li>secondary, conventional, iconographic</li>

        <ul>
        <li>sources are eclectic and intertextual: look for “coherent
        pattern of statements across a range of archives and sites”</li>
        <li>after the establishing some of the more obvious sources,
        start to widen. this can be time-consuming and one of the
        difficulties is to know, when to stop gathering sources</li>
        <li>Cowling: look and state commonalities in the different
        texts</li>
        <li>look at your sources with fresh eyes, forget all
        preconceptions</li>
        <li>immerse yourself in the sources; read and re-read them again
        and again, look carefully</li>
        <li>identify key themes</li>
        <li>how do these produce their effects of truth; look for
        processes of persuasion (works that try to establish truth
        dominance, ie “scientific” studies)</li>
        <li>also look at complexity and contradictions within a given
        discourse; also called interpretative repertoire</li>
        <li>last but not least, look for invisibility; that which is not
        seen or said</li>
        <li>read your sources with great care for detail</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An important aspect is to find the institutional location of
