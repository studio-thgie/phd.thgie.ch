- communication codes have their roots in imperial and military history
- it then took on the meaning of the written laws
- it’s understanding diverged from today’s, because of the advent of cipher

This translation of an embodied practice (sorting letters by occurrence, to ease printing work) has a stark relation to the history of the Chinese typewriter.

There we have it again, our beloved capitalism. So code IS description, and, through it’s ability to encode as well as certain programming structures, such as OOP or functions, become highly efficient.

- Kittler warns of the fallacy to see code in everything, and reminds of it’s relation to imperialism and capitalism

## Annotations
> In 1838, Samuel Morse is said to have inspected a printing plant in New York in order—taking a leaf from Alberti’s book—to learn from the letter case which letters occurred most frequently and therefore required the shortest Morse signals.10 For the first time a system of writing had been optimized according to technical criteria—that is, with no regard to semantics—but the product was not yet known as Morse code. (p. 58)

> Input is bad if it is longer than its output; both are equally long in the case of white noise; and a code is called elegant if its output is much longer than itself. The twentieth century thus turned a thoroughly capitalist money-saving device called “code condenser” into highest mathematical stringency. (p. 58)

> The Turing machine of 1936, as the principle controller of any computer, solved a basic problem of the modern age: how to note with finitely long and ultimately whole numbers the real, and therefore typically infinitely long, numbers on which technology and engineering have been based since Viète’s time. (p. 58)

> Today, technology puts code into the practice of realities, that is to say: it encodes the world. (p. 60)

> either we write code that in the manner of natural constants reveals the determinations of the matter itself, but at the same time pay the price of millions of lines of code and billions of dollars for digital hardware; or else we leave the task up to machines that derive code from their own environment, although we then cannot read—that is to say: articulate—this code (p. 61)

> anybody who has written code even only once, be it in a high-level programming language or assembly, knows two very simple things from personal experience. For one, all words from which the program was by necessity produced and developed only lead to copious errors and bugs; for another, the program will suddenly run properly when the programmer’s head is emptied of words (p. 61)
