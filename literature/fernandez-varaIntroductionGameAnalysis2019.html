        <p>Fernández-Vara, C. (2019). <em>Introduction to game
        analysis</em> (Second edition). Routledge.</p>
        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>“This accessible textbook gives students the tools they need
        to analyze games using strategies borrowed from textual
        analysis. As the field of game studies grows, videogame writing
        is evolving from the mere evaluation of gameplay, graphics,
        sound, and replayablity, to more reflective writing that manages
        to convey the complexity of a game and the way it is played in a
        cultural context. Clara Fernández-Vara’s concise primer provides
        readers with instruction on the basic building blocks of game
        analysis–examination of context, content and reception, and
        formal qualities–as well as the vocabulary necessary for talking
        about videogames’ distinguishing characteristics. Examples are
        drawn from a range of games, both digital and non-digital–from
        Bioshock and World of Warcraft to Monopoly–and the book provides
        a variety of exercises and sample analyses, as well as a
        comprehensive ludography and glossary. In this second edition of
        the popular textbook, Fernández-Vara brings the book firmly
        up-to-date, pulling in fresh examples from ground-breaking new
        works in this dynamic field. Introduction to Game Analysis
        remains a unique practical tool for students who want to become
        more fluent writers and critics of not just video games, but
        digital media overall”–</p>

        <p>The author Clara Fernández-Vara proposes to read and analyze
        video games like texts. This brings Barthes Mythologies to mind,
        which she later in the text confirms.</p>

        concept of text can be applied to activities and artifacts that
        may also be a form of human expression” (<a
        href="zotero://select/library/items/E4SEXMNR">Fernández-Vara,
        2014, p. 6</a>)</p>
        <p>The concept of text can be applied to the things themselves,
        to the things surrounding the things (paratexts), to the things
        reading the things, and so forth.</p>
        <p>Can a video game be understood as a way of communication?
        Yes, and they’re also artifacts that hold values and ideas,
        which the game’s players interact with. Textual analysis uses
        inductive reasoning to produce general theories.</p>
        <p>This book tries to broaden the discourse and produce a canon
        of of works related to game studies. Reasons on p.11.</p>

        the field of study that I’m approaching it from? Who am I

        <p>These are some general but important questions before

        playing, reading, writing, rewriting</li>

        <h3 id="playing-the-game-critically-3">Playing the game

        <li>choose how to play the game, methodical-wise</li>
        <li>how much playing has to be done for the playing to be
        “finished”</li>
        <li>critical distance is hard to maintain as a
        player/writer</li>
        <li>we can also mistake ourselves for an “ideal” (abstract”)
        player</li>
        <li>phenomenology’s bracketing method can help:
        self-examination</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <ul>
        <li>game capital is the knowledge we can aquire about games and
        playing them; cheats and walkthroughs and similar things count
        amongst that capital</li>
        <li>game capital belong to the circumstances of play</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="gathering-information-about-the-game">Gathering
        information about the game</h3>
        <p>Since no cultural artifact is created and encountered in the
        void, the context of a game should also be analyzed.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>find what already has been written on the game</li>
        <li>be selective according to the goals (audience, question) you
        set out</li>
        <li>be source-critical</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <p>Possible <strong>context resources</strong> might
        include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>game box and manuals</li>
        <li>official websites</li>
        <li>the cabinet of arcade machines</li>
        <li>game reviews (vs. reception, retro reviews); don’t forget
        print</li>
        <li>academic articles; might be text on genre that includes
        reference to game</li>
        <li>press release and advertisements in print and other media
        (tv)</li>
        <li>newspaper articles</li>
        <li>developer diaries, talks and interviews</li>
        <li>development documentation</li>
        <li>design documents and development files</li>
        <li>postmortems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It would be helpful to categorize this resources a bit
        towards research goals.</p>
        <p>Another important source in the analysis of games is
        resorting to pre-existing theories to understand games, as in
        borrowing theory from other media.</p>
        <p>The original system that a game was intended to be played on
        might be a crucial part of the context analysis (see Duck Hunt
        and it’s gun-controller). We also might need access to different
        versions of a game (dev version, prod version, emulated,
        etc).</p>
        <p><strong>Secondary sources</strong></p>
        <p>Sometimes games might be (or include) a one-time or limited
        event. To study these, context becomes essential. Always play
        the game and if that is not possible, reconstruct as much as
        possible through it’s paratexts.</p>
        <hr />
        <ul>
        <li>Some analysis might need to include player data</li>
        <li>experiential aspects of a video game are essential in order
        to understand it; spoilers might be in the way of that, but
        sometimes it will be important to make a point</li>

        Videogames are the product of their time, therefore learning

        they were produced is crucial to understand them.” (<a

        elements helps readers situate themselves by explaining briefly
        what the game is about. This section is common to all types of
        analysis, as we will see in Chapter 6, although focusing
        exclusively on the content may be the subject of some specific
        models of journalistic game reviews, which are closer to
        consumer reports. By taking into account how the game was
        played, appropriated, and transformed by the community, the
        analysis also acknowledges that games are a human activity, not
        merely a set of rules or code in a computer.” (<a

        technical specifications, or a breakdown of specific design
        features that may be typical of some game reviews. An analysis
        of the formal aspects must inquire how they work, hypothesize
        why they are there, and most importantly, how they relate to the
        player’s experience.” (<a

        <p>There is a lot of overlapping in the building blocks to game
        over view and formal elements, especially concerning the rules,
        mechanics and the world of the game. The “verbs” of a game
        appear often, indicating the importance of looking at the
        interactive part.</p>

        <p>“• Purpose: What is the goal of the game? What is it trying
        to achieve? What values does it try to transmit?<br />
        • Content and information: What is the information that the game
        is trying to get across? What is the game trying to teach?<br />
        • Game mechanics: What are the rules of the game? What are the
        main verbs of the game? How hard/difficult is it?<br />
        • Fiction and narrative: What is the fictional world of the
        game? How does the context relate to the content it wants to get
        across?<br />
        • Aesthetics and graphics: How does the game set up a tone and
        environment to the player?<br />
        • Framing: Who is the game intended for? How much are they
        supposed to know about games before playing?<br />
        • Cohesiveness: Can we consider the game as using procedural
        rhetoric? Are the values that the game tries to convey
        integrated in the mechanics? Does the audience it is intended
        for actually play this type of game?” (<a
