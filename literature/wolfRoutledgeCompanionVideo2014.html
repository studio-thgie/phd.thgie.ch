        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>“The number of publications dealing with video game studies
        has exploded over the course of the last decade, but the field
        has not yet produced a comprehensive reference work. The
        Routledge Companion to Video Game Studies, by well-known video
        game scholars Mark Wolf and Bernard Perron, aims to address the
        on-going theoretical and methodological development of game
        studies, providing students, scholars, and game designers with a
        definitive look at contemporary video game studies. Features
        include: -comprehensive and interdisciplinary models and
        approaches for analyzing video games; -new perspectives on video
        games both as art form and cultural phenomenon; -explorations of
        technical and creative dimensions of video games; -accounts of
        the economical, political, social, and cultural dynamics of
        video games”–</p>

        different ways, whether because of the player’s hardware or the
        emulator’s lack of precision itself. For instance, different
        screens render graphics in different ways. A 1980s NTSC TV set
        is not as precise as a 2010s DEL screen. The cathode-ray tubes
        of home TV sets and arcade cabinets give a blurry quality to the
        graphics that masks “imperfections” in the final render
        (Therrien, 2012, p. 15). In terms of preservation, a sharp-edged
        pixel is not faithful to what a common player experienced in the
        1980s. Even pixel aspect ratios are different from one screen
        type to another. Moreover, the GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin
        can upscale the original resolution up to 1080p, which of course
        is not faithful to the original conception.” (<a

        some emulator projects. For those behind the MAME project,
        playing the game is considered merely a “nice side effect”
        (MAME, n.d.) from their objectives. Sure, you have to actually
        play the games to see if the emulation worked; but making games
        easily playable (on a modern PC) is not a specific goal they
        pursue.” (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/L8CTY6WF">“The

        <p>Although emulation is though of giving access to old games,
        it can be quite daunting and difficult to create the right setup
        to play a game. Given you’ll have the game files and are ready
        to dabble in some legal grey zone.</p>

        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/65H72L3G?page=53&amp;annotation=29EEK78Y">Go
        to annotation</a>“Emulation is not a preservation of every
        aspect of an apparatus, but it is still a convenient and
        accessible way to have an experience analogous to the one on the
        original system. This “second-hand” experience requires scholars
        to be aware of the technical and cultural differences between
        the two systems.” (<a

        <p>Conclusion: Emulation can make gameplay accessible, but it
        will also change it. It is thus important to be reflective of
        that and to contextualize it and not use it as the sole source
        of analyzing a game.</p>
