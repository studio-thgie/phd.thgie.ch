\subsubsection{Notes along reading}

\subsubsection{Ergodic Literature}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
ergodic points towards more effort than just eye movements and turning pages

\item 
cybertext denotes structure, not content or genre

\item 
long excursion on texts and labyrinths

\item 
going into examples of ergodic lit

\item 
databases introduced new possibilities for producing ergodic text

\end{itemize}

\par
“For the first time, this breaks down concepts such as "the text itself" into two independent technological levels: the interface and the storage medium.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 17)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
aarseth describing source code on p.11 is interesting and insightful

\item 
mentioning of the “ergodic textual machines”

\item 
some words of heed towards literary research on cybertexts as well as the concept of social change through new technologies

\item 
raising the question on what is a text

\item 
Aarseth already being fed up with academic skirmishes in 1997

\end{itemize}

\par
“Isn't the content of a text more important than these materialistic, almost ergonomic, concerns?” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 24)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
must be a sarcasto-rhetoric question, since cybertext is about structuring texts

\end{itemize}

\par
“If it [a difference] exists, it must be described in functional, rather than material or historical, terms.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 24)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
there you go

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Problems in Computer Semiotics}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
focus on functionality of the different texts and medias, trying to get a pluralist perspective

\item 
reading is not just between reader and text but also includes context and world

\item 
on the fields focus on books and ignorance of any other textual media

\item 
Aarseth adding cybertext as a textual definition such as phenomenological, semiotic, etc

\end{itemize}

\par
“[Cybertext as] as a material machine, a device capable of manipulating itself as well as the reader” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 31)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
going into the problems of computer semiotics, which seem to be ideologically influenced

\item 
until recently, semiotics concentrated mostly on the static and linear, not bein able to encompass the dynamic and varied

\item 
a very interesting part on complexity and autonomy (in response to Jensen differentiation of semiotics and signal processing) leading to a discussion on how a program will have results that couldn’t have been predicted by the programmer on p.27

\item 
on the global stock market as a transgression of the semiosis-signal-processing threshold

\item 
this longer, a bit tougher to read part, goes essentially into the problems of how meaning arises in between computational signal processing and human semiotics; is that not a bit the part that I’m also struggling with in understanding? I saw this process much more as a specific moment then an assemblage, but it would be interesting to map this out once

\end{itemize}

\par
“The crucial issue here is how to view systems that feature what is known, as emergent behavior, systems that are complex structures evolving unpredictably from an initial set of simple elements.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 36)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
on the problems of generative/emergent behaviour

\item 
Andersen’s classification of semiotic signs: permanence, transience, handling and action; classes: interactive, actor, object, button, controller, layout, ghost

\item 
Critique of Andersen’s classification as it is insufficient along the line of applying the system to buttons as well as it’s application on Breakout and Lemmings

\end{itemize}

\par
“When the relationship between surface sign and user is all that matters, the unique dual materiality of the cybernetic sign process. is disregarded. Without an understanding of this duality, however, analyses of communicative phenomena involving cybernetic sign production become superficial and incomplete.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 47)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
basically a call for action in 1997, and … THIS

\end{itemize}

\par
“In short, the dual nature of the cybernetic sign process can be described as follows: while some signification systems, such as painted pictures and printed books, exist on only one material level (i.e., the level of paint and canvas, or of ink and paper), others exist on two or more levels, as a book being read aloud (ink-paper and voicesoundwaves) or a moving picture being projected (the film strip and the image on the silver screen). In these latter cases, the relationship between the two levels may be termed trivial, as the transformation from one level to the other (what we might call the secondary sign production) will always be, if not deterministic, then at least dominated by the material authority of the first level. In the cybernetic sign transformation, however, the relationship might be termed arbitrary, because the internal, coded level can only be fully experienced by way of the external, expressive level.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 47)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
the in-depth explanation of the cybernetic sign process is pure gold as it is foundational to my dissertation project

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Textuality, Nonlinearity, and Interactivity}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
I can’t follow the part on nonlinear text, there seems to be many reference to discourse that I’m not familiar with, but I’m also not sure if it’s important at the moment for me

\item 
discussion of nonlinear vs. multilinear; the importance of defining the poit of perspective (writter, user, the net itself, the possible courses)

\item 
hypermedia are topologically nonlinear

\item 
when we describe things, ie as cybertext, it is important to outline if we describe the thing or doing the thing (writing vs writings)

\item 
interactive as a term that doesn’t mean much

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cyborg Aesthetics and the “Work in Movement”}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
cyborg aesthetics!

\item 
shout-out to Donna Haraway and her appropriation and theoretisation of the cyborg

\item 
cyborg as play at the boundary of machine-humane

\item 
writing as a cyborg technology

\item 
text as a machine, symbiosis of sign, operator and medium; being of linguistic, historical and material phenomena

\item 
cyborg fields being dominated by issues of domination and control; author, text, or reader control

\end{itemize}

\subsection{A Typology of Textual Communication}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
reviewing previous efforts, such as Bordewijk and can Kaam’s typology of traffic patterns: allocution, consultation, registration, and conversation

\item 
Aarseth is interested in textual systems, less the social ones

\item 
explaining his methodology: categorizing texts then employing \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_analysis}{correspondence analysis} and pointing to possible shortcomings (which was interesting to me)

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Typology}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
text isn’t really defined and that is helping and hindering a proper analysis

\item 
broad definition of text: relays verbal communication, thus is depending on material medium and is not equal to the information it transmits

\item 
strings appearing for the ideal reader: scriptons (the reader might not read it accordingly)

\item 
strings existing in text: textons

\item 
texts consists of traversal function, the generation of scriptons from textons

\item 

\par
variables
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
See (Aarseth, 1997, p. 72) for summarizing table

\item 
dynamics: amount of scriptons and textons

\item 
determinability: if adjacent scriptos stay the same or not

\item 
transiency: if the scriptons change by themselves or through interaction

\item 
perspective: im/personal

\item 
access: codex is random access, hypertext w/o search are more linear

\item 
linking: links, conditional links, no links

\item 
user functions: interpretative, explorative, configurative, textonic (user can add textons or traversal functions)

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Texts}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
he chose 23 texts based on the variables outlined before

\item 
then applied the correspondence analysis with the help of Analytica producing some matrices that position the works according to their variables

\end{itemize}

\par
“The concept of text, always contested and problematized, is once again under reconfiguration. Should we use the same term for phenomena as diverse as Moby Dick and MUDs? Or for that matter, the I Ching and Moby Dick?” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 80)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
conclusion: reader might not be an appropriate term; they certainly must more then just read depending on the kind of text

\item 
the avoidance of industry-provided terminology by falling back to the parameters is a nice move

\end{itemize}

\par
“new media do not appear in opposition to the old but as emulators of features and functions that are already invented” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 81)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
based on anaylsis and conclusion, suggests cybertext as the term for texts which include calculation in the production of scriptons

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hypertext Aesthetics}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
aesthetics as the motives that produce hypertexts and their poetics

\item 
hypertextual reading is not equivalent with writing, at least not with the writing the author can do; the semantic units/signs have different scopes and allow for different kinds of failures (the author can chain random letters to produce unmeaningful material, but play with the signs in a much broader scope)

\item 
hypertext doesn’t seem much different from older writing media and it is less freely in terms of tmesis

\end{itemize}

\par
“We might say that hypertext punishes tmesis by controlling the text's fragmentation and pathways and by forcing the reader to pay attention to the strategic links.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 85)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
“hypertext labyrinth (what I later call an ergodic aporia)” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 86)

\item 
talking about hypertext as a ideological and technological category, applying proper discourse analysis

\item 
web-based hypertext as having place and regaining parts of its aura, since it cannot be reproduced fully

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Paradigms of Hypertext}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
I do love the inclusion of power-analysis in bits of Aarseth’ text

\end{itemize}

\par
“Contrary to Nelson's idealistic claim [computers are about human freedom], the purpose of computers is power, and hypertext is as much involved in that struggle for power as anything else.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 89)
\par
“To claim that hypertext is fulfilling "postmodern theory"-and that "postmodern theorists have been doing this (i.e., describing hypertext] without knowing it" (24)-is an attempt to colonize several rather different critical fields by replacing their empirical object or objects on the imperialist pretext that they did not really have one until now.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 90)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
deconstructing the ideology of hypertext as the the superior text

\item 
fiction and narrative being of different types of categories and thus, can’t be the same

\item 
the deep reading of hypertext fiction/narrative and what’s what eludes me at times

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Sense of a Novel: Michael Joyce’s Afternoon}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
interesting approach to critiquing tech vs. content

\end{itemize}

\par
“Instead of asking, What have I read? the critic might become preoccupied with the question, Have I read all? and come to identify the task of interpretation as a task of territorial exploration and technological mastery.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 94)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
reverse engineering hypertext structures

\end{itemize}

\par
“As one of the programers behind Storyspace, Afternoon's hypertext system, Bolter is in an excellent position to demystify the text. Afternoon is certainly mapable; it can be loaded into the full version of Storyspace and its links studied there in detail.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 95)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
pondering on the term interactive fiction

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{\emph{The Rhetoric of Hyperliteralture: Aporia and Epiphany}}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
on hypertext mechanisms and what they affect; from aporia to epiphany

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{\emph{The Poetics of Conflict: Ergodics versus Narration}}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
skipped this part; exhaustive discussion of Afternoon

\end{itemize}

\subsection{5 Intrigue and Discourse in the Adventure Game}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
recounting the beginnings of the arpanet/net/internet as well as the advent of \emph{Adventure}, and how the latter migrated across the former

\end{itemize}

\par
“Mary Ann Buckles (1985, 79) argues convincingly that Adventure can be classified as "folk art," in contrast to the popular commercial genre it later gave birth to.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 107)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
explains how a adventure game works

\item 
goes into \emph{Adventure}’s derivates, as well as into the demise of the genre

\item 
according to Brenda Laurel, the end of text adventures was due to the development of image based games

\end{itemize}

\par
“According to Brenda Laurel (1991, 97n), the first graphical adventure game was created by Warren Robinett for Atari in 1979. In the early 1980s, computer graphics became better and cheaper, and so the adventure game genre, with its spatially oriented themes of travel and discovery, gradually migrated from text to pictures and, eventually, to three-dimensional "virtual reality" games like Doom, by John Romero, John Carmack, and Adrian Carmack (1993), or multipath movies like the current Hollywood CD-ROM productions.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 108)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
detailing the influence and importance of \emph{Rogue} on the genre and demise of text aventures, although ASCII based

\end{itemize}

\par
“Images, especially moving images, are more powerful representations of spatial relations than texts, and therefore this migration from text to graphics is natural and inevitable.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 109)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
positioning the ergodic structure of \emph{Adventure} as the base of pretty much all interactive games, despite these having much better graphics

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{\emph{A Schematic Model of Internal Structure}}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
see graphic p.104

\item 
components: data, processing engines, interace, user

\item 
going into the details of this generalized model

\item 
talking about ideal and corruptible readers (players)

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{\emph{Some Issues in Advanture Game Critisicm}}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
adventure games are not novels, they are a genre in themselves, and, something new

\item 
often missing historical perspectives

\end{itemize}

\par
“Adventure, despite its obvious debt to Dungeons and Dragons, transcended the cultural position of a singular text and became a mythological urtext, located everywhere and nowhere, sometimes even incorrectly backdated to the early sixties.” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 114)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
on the adventure game and hypertext literature and their prominence in literature analysis, the former being “entertainment”, foreshadowing the ignorance on games as an important cultural product

\item 
on players participation as just filling gaps, which is misleading

\end{itemize}

\par
I skipped the literary analysis of most of the works.
\par
\subsection{Conclusions: The Ideology of Influence}

\par
“But are we the cocreators of these images? Only in a noematic sense. The coded images are objectively there, just like encrypted messages that can be deciphered only with a certain key, and we can no more influence their appearance than we can influence a Rembrandt or a Van Gogh” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 187)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
pointing towards the illustion of cocreation, participation and the like (the player does not touch the codebase, not altering the rules/ergodic structures of the game)

\end{itemize}

  abstract = {This paper lays out a unified framework of the ergodic animage, the rule-based and interactiondriven part of visual representation in video games. It is the end product of a three-year research project conducted by the INTEGRAE team, and is divided into three parts. Part 1 contextualizes the research on graphics and visuality within game studies, notably through the opposition between fiction and rules and the difficulties in finding common vocabulary to discuss key visual concepts such as perspective and point of view. Part 2 discusses a number of visual traditions through which we frame video game graphics (film, animation, art history, graphical projection and technical drawing), highlighting their relevance and shortcomings in addressing the long history of video games and the very different paradigms of 2D and 3D graphics. Part 3 presents the Game FAVR, a model that allows any game’s visual representation to be described and discussed through a common frame and vocabulary. The framework is presented in an accessible manner and is organized as a toolkit, with sample case studies, templates, and a flowchart for using the FAVR provided as an annex, so that researchers and students can immediately start using it.},
  issue = {14},
  langid = {english},
  note = {\subsection{Notes}

\par
The paper tries to develop it’s own framework on addressing visuality of video games, the problem being, that the common terms up to this point were lent from other media and might not be able to encompass what makes games games.
\par
There are three parts in this paper
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item 
The study of graphics in games studies

\item 
Traditions of visuality in studying video game graphics

\item 
The game FAVR

\end{enumerate}

\par
Others how did similar, but usually had very broad aims, trying to encompass all the different aspects of video games.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
“Game Ontology Project” (Arsenault et al., p. 89), which might be abandoned

\item 
“Patterns in Game Design” (Arsenault et al., p. 89)

\end{itemize}

\par
FAVR instead concentrates only on the visual aspects. It addresses four problems. A unified framework…
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item 
…should be able to deal with any video game, no matter the diversity of aspects it might contain

\item 
…needs to clear terminological confusion, being able to address the interesting, novel or banal features of a game

\item 
…needs to account for the different types and styles of video game graphics

\item 
…should use a accessible vocabulary that also enables the integration of future developments

\end{enumerate}

\par
Within M. Nitsche’s model of analytical planes, FAVR is concerned mainly with the mediated one. It is mainly interested in the interactive parts of visuality.
\par
“Bernadette Flynn (2003) writes that the “satisfaction” or “fun” of the player does not stem from narrative construction, but rather from the sensation of embodiment in the navigational space.” (Arsenault et al., p. 91)
\par
This is probably a fun point to discuss with my fellow researchers.
\par
\subsubsection{Ergodic Animage}

\par
The paper \href{http://gamestudies.org/0801/articles/hutch}{Making the Water Move} also references ergodicity.
\par
“Aarseth’s (1997) ergodicity (the interactive process of working to create a path through the configuration of a textual machine with no guarantee of success (p.1, p.179))” (Arsenault et al., p. 91)
\par
“Gaudreault and Marion’s (2013) animage (a “ type of film image that is born from the expressive potential of the digital and that crystallizes the current spreading of a cultural series formerly neglected by the cinema institution: animation” (p.256))” (Arsenault et al., p. 91)
\par
“The ergodic animage is the meeting point and mediating factor between the player’s agency and the game’s visual representation of its internal state.” (Arsenault et al., p. 91)
\par
\subsection{Framing Games through Film Studies}

\par
The paper goes into how a film studies vocabulary was applied to analyse and describe video games. That was partially working but in many more cases, isn’t adequate. The authors then point towards animetism as a better working approach to describe video game graphics. It does account for 2d and 3d modes.
\par
“Animetism is an important visual paradigm to understand video games for two converging reasons: the importance of materials, and the composite nature of the image.” (Arsenault et al., 2015, p. 98)
\par
The point towards materials is interesting. Composition points towards the layered mode of animation, in 2d as well as 3d. Things are put on top of each other, iE a character on top of a background. It also points towards the mixed us of material, iE photos and pixelgraphics.
\par
\subsubsection{“Art History and Technical Drawing, from Perspective to Parallel Projection” (Arsenault et al., 2015, p. 100)}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Perspective as the default visual logic as until today, whereas alternatives would exist

\item 
Perspective = subject-centered

\item 
Project = object-centered

\item 
visual choices are deliberate and correlate with different types of gameplay: “parallel projection calls for a managerial relationship with space” (Arsenault et al., 2015, p. 100)

\end{itemize}

\par
Now, video games can employ several of this approaches in “hybrid visuo-spatial configurations” (Arsenault et al., 2015, p. 101). Games exploring non-euclidiean spaces are referred to as XD games by the authors.
\par
\subsection{The Game FAVR}

\par
The authors point out once again, that they have a focus on the visuality and not the narrative aspects. In their words, the “[mediated] space […] is thus intelligible or not (rather than simulated or not, diegetic or not, or fictional or simulated (Aarseth, 2007)) because of its communicative nature” (Arsenault et al., 2015, p. 102)
\par
The framwork relies on four parameters and their components:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 

\par
composition
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
tangible space (sensation of agency)

\item

“Facing any image, we ask the question: how can the image itself demonstrate to a player the range of possible actions that she is allowed to do? The question of evaluating the efficiency of particular narrative strategies that aim to produce a diegetic world is not the focus here. This is a key choice since our framework needs to also cover games that don’t project a fictional world, such as the famous example of Tetris in game studies’ earliest controversies.” (Arsenault et al., 2015, p. 102)
\par
A major aspect of the FAVR are visual modes, iE Super Marios Bros 3 title screen, message screen and gameplay screens. These “are created by the analyst for the purpose of discussing and analyzing games” (Arsenault et al., 2015, p. 103)
\par
\subsubsection{Composition}

\par
Is the first aspect that should be analyzed and relates to how the different areas of the screens are occupied functionally in terms of player agency.
\par
\subsubsection{Ocularization}

\par
This part is tough to follow and needs revisiting later on.
\par
\subsubsection{Framing mechanisms}

\par
Anchor and mobility of the frame are two elements of the regimental aspects of graphical regimes. “they are the descriptors of the kinetic qualities of the game’s graphics in relation to player control.” (Arsenault et al., 2015, p. 111)
\par
\subsubsection{The three planes}

\par
Can be applied to 2d and 3d visualities. Is mostly descriptive.},

This is a book about Nintendo, and how it lived the "16-bit console wars" that saw it go from being the undisputed industry leader in the 8-bit generation of consoles with more than a 90\% market share in 1989 to a marginally leading top player with a 60\% share of the video game market at the end of the 16-bit console war, and all the way down to its Nintendo 64 selling a little less than one-third as many units as Sony's dominating PlayStation console.

Both - Are broadly applicable across subject matters - concern the particular and the probable - require invention and judgment, and - involve arrangement in space and time From ancient times through the Renaissance, rhetoric was a key element in education, and its methods were widely adapted to other arts, including design. Rhetoric's loss of status in modern times is explained, and its resurgence in the latter part of the 20th century is described through the works of three scholars that focus on the relationship between rhetoric and design. The conceptualization of these scholars is best represented in the view that rhetoric is design limited to words and design is rhetoric with an unlimited palette.},

- For all the data algorithms calculate and the resulting impact upon people’s social, legal, and financial lives, I tend to think of these language objects as quasi-rhetorical agents with persuasive abilities. — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:11:33](https://hyp.is/40HvrvO4Ee2bcC9uruM-7g/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public
\par
- Although the traditional ways of thinking about computer algorithms do not usually include discussions of persuasion, I nevertheless maintain algorithms are persuasive because of their performative nature and the values and beliefs embedded and encoded in their structures. — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:12:06](https://hyp.is/9zhobPO4Ee2coOs2O52fDA/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public

- It is my inkling that persuasion and agency finds its way in non-human language objects, i.e., computer code. — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:28:16](https://hyp.is/OTFjevO7Ee2pYc9GNkxdGQ/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public

- one might conclude algorithms as agnostic language objects — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:32:09](https://hyp.is/xBwbsPO7Ee2u39MtnMJqQQ/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public
\par
- One might also conclude that conceptions about algorithms run deep in Western values of logic and organization. Within the definitional parameters is evidence of how people in Western societies think and communicate. There is evidence of a basic relationship of problem and solution. There is also evidence of the limiting factors of what algorithms can and cannot do, and what algorithms perform and “know” about the real and artificial of knowledge exchange. — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:32:53](https://hyp.is/3mZuEvO7Ee2Z119kyIjHgQ/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public
\par
- Algorithms in a rhetorical sense, seen from the view of the author or team of creators are invented, arranged, styled, memorized (in multiple senses), and delivered. Does it necessarily follow then that these non-human language objects, that influence real change in stock markets, financial data, dating sites, and social media spaces, are persuasive in and of themselves? Do computer algorithms persuade? — [Updated on 2023-05-16 09:35:22](https://hyp.is/NxWymPO8Ee2u4atQCUPcdg/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public
\par
- Code that runs on a machine is performative in a much stronger sense than that attributed to language. When language is said to be performative, the kinds of actions it “performs” happen in the minds of humans, as when someone says, “I declare this legislative session open” or “I pronounce you husband and wife.” Granted, these changes in the mind can and do result in behavioral effects, but the performative force of language is nonetheless tied to the external changes through complex chains of mediation. By contrast, code running in a digital computer causes changes in machine behavior and, through networked ports and other interfaces, may initiate other changes, all implemented in the transmission of code.

- The machine does not summon creative variances of {$<$}blockquote{$>$} based on histories and contexts, but instead performs the programming of the element in the mode the programmers designed {$<$}blockquote{$>$} to perform—through all of the frontend and backend languages, compilers, and machine code. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 14:46:20](https://hyp.is/0nVALvSwEe22tnebRfDO6Q/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public
\par
- However, in thinking through the intersubjective mediation of humans attaching multiple meanings to a single word or word-concept, and only one meaning attached to the element {$<$}blockquote{$>$}, there is still meaning attached to the element/code when the machine performs the function, however limited that may be in material/computational spaces. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 14:46:50](https://hyp.is/5FYpSPSwEe2oF88jvIirvA/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public
\par
- In service to the philosophical and theoretical considerations of persuasion, if computer algorithms produce their own machinic contexts, which aren’t as highly unique as human contexts when associating concepts with words, then consideration of the performativity of code—of algorithms—takes root. Within the machinic context, the relationship of language and force binds in an ephemeral state. By ephemeral, I mean giving rise to a context for a written act to occur and with the close of the act, the context of the written act concluding, with the spatial and temporal elements of the context dissipating. Such theoretical ground calls to mind Thomas Rickert’s discussions of khôra. In examining the works for Kristeva, Derrida, and Ulmer, Ricket notes that “chōra~transforms our senses of beginning, creation, and invention by placing them concretely within material environments, informational spaces, and affective (or bodily) registers” (252). This view illustrates another way of locating code and algorithms within rhetoric’s sphere as a khôraic being and non-being of what rhetoric encapsulates. While Rickert notes this conversation gives rise to rhetorical invention—for Derrida, rhetoric’s place in invention also calls attention—albeit briefly—to the spatial and temporal dimensions which discourse (and I would add the performativity of computer code) resides. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:15:19](https://hyp.is/3xCmnvS0Ee2SSRe0bs4wlQ/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public

- Annotation: What?
\par
- The reciprocal and reflexive nature of algorithms in transactional inventions highlights the relationships in the network of actants, drawing upon Latour’s actor-network theory. The non-human actant computer algorithm performs in the interaction of inputs and outputs of data. In some sense, Latour’s idea of the “delegation to non-humans” wherein objects define how people or other objects move or respond, hints at a type of agency. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:16:30](https://hyp.is/CYAdxPS1Ee2Ug1-62laSBA/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public
\par
- Interdisciplinary theorist Lucas Introna, who routinely publishes on the ethics of technology and surveillance, argues that the performativity of computer code should be understood in terms of the encoding process from agent—to transmission—to receiver, and as such encoded language objects are extensions of agency. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:19:47](https://hyp.is/fttKEvS1Ee2DO6MlXmoknA/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public

- the changes algorithms produce and affect as a force go deeper than agency and cut at persuasive design. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:20:55](https://hyp.is/p7OJIvS1Ee28QaeNlT2hag/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public
\par
- Persuasive computer algorithms are written-only language objects with encoded agency, transactional invention, and embedded values, beliefs, and logics of the three rhetorical appeals performing functions that provide the grounds for human and non-human change. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:27:51](https://hyp.is/n23S-PS2Ee2K719eghg6vA/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public
\par
- First, algorithms can be a systematic way of processing and organizing information for persuasive means that logic aids in ordering how humans and machines experience the world around them. Second, algorithms are decisive in inclusionary and exclusionary practices of using or discarding data that does not fit the structure of the algorithmic model. In this sense, if an algorithm’s structure only allows for data collection from websites with over 20 hyperlinks, the websites with less than 20 links will be excluded from the dataset. Finally, algorithms are quasi-objective ideological structures, in that the creation of an algorithmic structure relies upon the knowledge and experience base of the creator(s), and ideological bias will always seep through in the creation of the structure for better or for worse. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:28:41](https://hyp.is/vYyehvS2Ee2yYs-M-cCdsg/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public
\par
- However, if our colleagues from literature and critical theory use the training and tools developed from their home disciplines in the field of critical code studies, then why not have digital rhetoricians use their social scientific and humanities-based theories and methodologies to study, theorize, and play with algorithms and code? — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:39:16](https://hyp.is/N709rvS4Ee2WUe9CpLa-vw/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public
\par
- What makes a rhetorical code studies different (if at all) from a critical code studies? Certainly one variance would come from different methodological approaches, with critical code studies relying upon hermeneutics and rhetorical code studies also offering such an approach along with social science methodologies. — [Updated on 2023-05-17 15:40:24](https://hyp.is/YHvF2vS4Ee24kv9Q5R4-hQ/www.enculturation.net/a-theory-of-persuasive-computer-algorithms) — Group: \#Public},

While previous scholarship tends to examine the aesthetics of video game as a homogenous, self-contained genre that can be clearly defined and understood within the framework of a variety of dichotomies, thinking of video game through the lens of the Denkbild allows us to understand the diversity, conditionality, and incommensurability of game as a multimedia aesthetic object. By presenting two snapshots of video game players, the collector and the glitcher, this paper argues that the concept of Denkbild allows us to better understand the relationships between game, gamers, and the socio-political context in terms of unexpected bonds, accidental breakthroughs, and moments of absolute freedom.},

Throughout, Collins and Evans ask an important question: how can the public make use of science and technology before there is consensus in the scientific community? This book has wide implications for public policy and for those who seek to understand science and benefit from it.“Starts to lay the groundwork for solving a critical problem—how to restore the force of technical scientific information in public controversies, without importing disguised political agendas.”—Nature“A rich and detailed ‘periodic table’ of expertise . . . full of case studies, anecdotes and intriguing experiments.”—Times Higher Education Supplement (UK)},

  abstract = {Critical code studies (CCS) is an emerging academic subfield, related to software studies, digital humanities, cultural studies, computer science, human–computer interface, and the do-it-yourself maker culture. Its primary focus is on the cultural significance of computer code, without excluding or focusing solely upon the code's functional purpose. According to Mark C. Marino, it is an approach that applies critical hermeneutics to the interpretation of computer code, program architecture, and documentation within a socio-historical context. CCS holds that lines of code are not value-neutral and can be analyzed using the theoretical approaches applied to other semiotic systems in addition to particular interpretive methods developed particularly for the discussions of programs. As introduced by Marino, critical code studies was initially a method by which scholars "can read and explicate code the way we might explicate a work of literature", but the concept also draws upon Espen Aarseth's conception of a cybertext as a "mechanical device for the production and consumption of verbal signs", arguing that in order to understand a digital artifact we must also understand the constraints and capabilities of the authoring tools used by the creator of the artifact, as well as the memory storage and interface required for the user to experience the digital artifact. Evidence that critical code studies has gained momentum since 2006 include an article by Matthew Kirschenbaum in The Chronicle of Higher Education, CCS sessions at the Modern Language Association in 2011 that were "packed" with attendees, several academic conferences devoted wholly to critical code studies, and a book devoted to the explication of a single line of computer code, titled 10 PRINT CHR\$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10.},

  abstract = {The applied research in Games employs numerous instruments to carry out its investigations. The search for scientifically based analysis demands strategies that are in line with expectations regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of their studies. The intrinsic heterogeneity of games also requires that the mode of research be opportunely flexible and straightforward, to cover a greater diversity of elements. Such convergence in diversity can occur through the standard set of playful impulses of language, ritual, and myth; and its relations with the natural signal aspects of the games: interface, mechanics and narrative. Considering these specific characteristics of the games focusing on their experiences provided through the signs created, specific experimental research procedures can be applied as a possibility of research methodology. In this sense, Semiotics, as a study on systems and phenomena of signification, has the appropriate attributes to be used in the scientific research of games endowed with the mentioned aspects. Several kinds of research on Games have already been made through Semiotics, but there is no description of procedures for its application, allowing Semiotics to be adopted in a schematic way of studying these contexts. For this reason, it is proposed a fundamental methodology that enables the use of Semiotics as research structured in Games considering its intrinsic characteristics of signification and experimentation. The definition of the method is based on the correlation between the categories Primeity, Secundity and Terceirity of Semiotics articulated with the interface, mechanics, and narrative of the research object, that is, the Game. In support of the theoretical rationale of the proposal, a summary methodology guide will support researchers in their application. Associating Semiotics with Games in a structured model allows for the logical cohesion of study and analysis activities, generating uniform results, but respecting the specificities of signs and experiences of each Game. To confirm the proposal, it will be applied in Study Cases with analog and digital games, demonstrating its organization, application, and flexibility of adoption.},

Denson analyzes works ranging from the Transformers series and Blade Runner 2049 to videogames and multimedia installations to show how what he calls discorrelated images—images that do not correlate with the abilities and limits of human perception—produce new subjectivities, affects, and potentials for perception and action. Denson's theorization suggests that new media theory and its focus on technological development must now be inseparable from film and cinema theory. There's more at stake in understanding discorrelated images, Denson contends, than just a reshaping of cinema, the development of new technical imaging processes, and the evolution of film and media studies: discorrelated images herald a transformation of subjectivity itself and are essential to our ability to comprehend nonhuman agency.},

  abstract = {Santiago Zabala reveals a crisis in modern society that perceives a world dominated by oppressive neoliberal ideology as acceptable and unproblematic. He claims that today’s greatest emergency is that we fail to notice other emergencies in society. To break out of this state, we need an aesthetic force to shock individuals into a new awareness. Unfortunately, while many social and global issues have recently come to widespread attention, the emergency still prevails in many forms of media. For example, the emergency in AAA video games appears in their continual push for higher resolution graphics, hyper-detail, verisimilitude, and intricate gameplay, perpetuating a hegemonic ideology. Exploitative labor practices, lack of representation beyond hetero-sexual, cis-gendered and neurotypical, and capitalist ideals are perpetuated in popular games in service of a hyper-real, high-fidelity aesthetic. One force that combats this emergency is pixel graphics and simplified gameplay, or post-retro aesthetics. While tied to the past, these aesthetics are not nostalgic but transgressively hauntological. To explore this claim, I discuss Dys4ia and Undertale as key post-retro games and reach beyond commercial indie gaming to point to hauntological work being done through DIY game making platformers such as Bitsy.},

Until recently, spectating has remained an analytical domain of film theory and visual arts. In game studies, this perspective has changed, with the arrival of the phenomenon of gameplay spectating and game streaming on a mass scale, and its leakage into academic as well as popular consciousness. How does the spectacle change the analytical perspective towards video games as objects of scholarly analysis and video gaming as reflective practice? In this paper, I will approach the video game as an algorithmic spectacle and propose an analytical perspective to study this phenomenon, reaching out to theories of moving (digital) image proposed by the philosopher Vilém Flusser and the filmmaker Harun Farocki.},

\textbf{Introduction: Through the Ludic Glass}
\par
Until recently the focus was on the player, whereas mass-watching let’s-plays and live-streams brought specating into focus.
\par
\begin{quotation}

\par
In my exploration of the spectacle then, I am not that much concerned with observing other human players at play, but with the question of the configurability and operationality of the displayed video game image.
\par
\end{quotation}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
The image in video games is not made of light, but of mathematics

\item 
This needs a different kind of visuality-literacy from the specators

\item 
the author builds on the concept of the technical image by Flusser and the operational image by Farocki

\item 
both concepts don’t represent or signify things found in reality, but construct their own

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Why Algorithmic Images Now?}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
on why it is important to study the image these days

\item 
she mentions a cartesian trap/dualism of differentiating between the visuality and it’s technicalities, a point that I started to make when researching the literature on the subject

\item 
i didn’t get the part on simulation at the end of this chapter

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Computed Representations / Represented Computations}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
video games as aesthetic forms that rely on the tension between representation and computation, see (Fizek, 2022, p. 4)

\item 
theoretical approaches to digital games often focus on the rule-based gameplay and submiss graphics and story

\item 
Aarseth sees a double-layered object of mechanis and semiotics (aesthetics?)

\item 
maybe it is exactly this binary that I want to tackle in my approach

\end{itemize}

\par
“As Aubrey Anable notices, “computation/representation has become the structuring binary for game studies”” (Fizek, 2022, p. 5)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
digital born images are no longer simply representations, they display operations of software, but are also operational (Fizek, 2022, p. 5)

\item 
making a link to Manovich’s work on the digital image

\item 
eine Lanze brechened, for the disolvement of the border between computation and representation

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Technical Images}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
going into the concept of technical images by Vilém Flusser, which are not inscribed into a material surface (like traditional images) but constructed from particles (chemical) and pixels (digital)

\item 
digital images are not a depiction, they are visualisations of computational processes

\item 
Flusser aplauds the observers capability to see the image in the digital image, by keeping their distance and not see the subface

\item 
this distance is different as standing apart from the image, it’s a distance of knowing/experience, it’s an epist-ontological distance

\item 
on the need of knowing the technical in technical images

\end{itemize}

\par
“Since technical images are no longer representations of the outside world but approximations and models of reality, their “critical reception ... demands a level of consciousness that corresponds to the one in which they are produced” (Flusser 1985/2011, p, 22)” (Fizek, 2022, p. 7)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Flusser making a case for studying how the images were produced

\item 
Marino echoeing Flusser with his approach to critical code studies

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Operational Images}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
outlining Farocki’s work and concept of operational image

\item 
operative images are also not representing, they have operational agency beyond deception/illusion

\item 
operation/operative as terms are quite open to interpretation in media studies, and Frieder Nake reads them synonymous with computability/algorithmicity

\item 
Manovich on the other hand reads operation as “technologically-based cultural practices,”

\end{itemize}

\par
“My own interpretation of operationality does not expand on Bogost’s “unit operations.” It is closely tied to the technical medium and builds upon Harun Farocki’s perspective, connecting operations with computational and algorithmic processes.” (Fizek, 2022, p. 9)
\par
\textbf{Watching through the Ludic-Glass}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
skimmed

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Layers of Spectated Meaning}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
going into how a Flusserian reading of video game images could look like

\item 
Mckeown defining “the image” as an ongoing conceptualized process

\item 
another approach would be Kittler’s decending observation

“In 1838, Samuel Morse is said to have inspected a printing plant in New York in order—taking a leaf from Alberti’s book—to learn from the letter case which letters occurred most frequently and therefore required the shortest Morse signals.10 For the first time a system of writing had been optimized according to technical criteria—that is, with no regard to semantics—but the product was not yet known as Morse code.” (“Software studies: a lexicon”, 2008, p. 58)

This translation of an embodied practice (sorting letters by occurrence, to ease printing work) has a stark relation to the history of the Chinese typewriter.

“Input is bad if it is longer than its output; both are equally long in the case of white noise; and a code is called elegant if its output is much longer than itself. The twentieth century thus turned a thoroughly capitalist money-saving device called “code condenser” into highest mathematical stringency.” (“Software studies: a lexicon”, 2008, p. 58)

His analysis casts light on how media-practical research forged common epistemic cause in programs that stretched from 1930s interwar computing at MIT and eugenics to the proliferation of seminars and laboratories in 1960s Paris. This mobilization ushered forth new fields of study such as structural anthropology, family therapy, and literary semiology while forming enduring intellectual affinities between the humanities and informatics.

introducing the need for an analysis of the “aesthetics of in-game photography” (Gerling et al., 2022, p. 264)

\item 
arguing that Overweg’s work at the limit of a game’s structures reveals in-game photography depending on the source game as \textbf{conditional cyberimage}

\item 
defining in-game photography

\item 
the relation between in-game photography its the source game is paradox: the game, gameness or gameplay is mostly absent, but the aesthetics of it are still present in the photo, similar to the machinima format

\end{itemize}

\par
“If a game is transformed into a film, the gameness or “gameplay” ceases to exist. In other words, “the game loses its rule set completely and ceases to be a game after all”.” (Gerling et al., 2022, p. 268)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
I had similar thoughts about screenshots and screencasts becoming secondary literature for a game; but, they might as well as be something entirely else

\item 
game art is a relapse, from ergodic media to the “object of a viewer’s gaze” (Gerling et al., 2022, p. 269)

\item 
author not happy with omission of discussion of significance of gameplay for in-game photography

\end{itemize}

next to game or text, a video game can/should be conceptualized as image

\item 
the image in game can be static, moving or interactive; the later being a image act (Bildakt)

\item 
…or as manipulable double image, whereas the latter is image and invisible code (double-sided)

\end{itemize}

\par
“Thomas Hensel emphasizes this action dimension of game images: Drawing on Kenneth Burke’s theory of action and John L. Austin’s speech act theory as well as from Horst Bredekamp’s work on Image Acts41, he conceptualizes the computer game as an image act (Bildakt). Due to the double-sided nature of digital images as proposed by Frieder Nake42, Hensel suggests regarding a digital image on a computer as a manipulable “double image”.43 Such images simultaneously consist of a visual surface and an invisible underside made up of (machine readable) code. Emphasizing the coded under-side of the image, Hensel goes on to say that computer game images are better understood as performative images and not as representational images. While playing a game, the players do more than merely appreciate the aesthetics of the computer game image; Hensel argues that they also interact with these images during gameplay. In other words, interacting with the game’s images is an essential part of the gameplay performance.” (Gerling et al., 2022, p. 273)

“A cyberimage is then a hybrid of a machine (the computer) and image (all visual signs perceivable by humans involved in computer gaming) where each realized sequence of images depends on the performance of a player with the machine which is in turn evaluated by the machine (Aarseth 1997).” (Gerling et al., 2022, p. 276)

  langid = {english},
  note = {\subsection{Notes}

\par
“This article develops a new approach to conceptualise video games as material and cultural heritage, and proposes a methodology for their study, especially those for which there is no original version left.” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 659)
\par
The authors propose an approach of collecting-as-much-as-possible, especially also paratexts and contextual information. The following quote is evocative and a beautiful rendition of the problem.
\par
“A ‘video game’ is not just software. It is consoles, living room couches, arcades, box art, supporting maps, magazines, and paraphernalia; it is everything that gives the act of ‘playing’ the game meaning.” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 660)
\par
The author goes on to propose different concepts in approaching the preservation of video games and their history.
\par
“The proposed methodology revolves around the concepts of intertextuality, paratextuality, aura, and assemblage theory.” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 660)
\par
Video games, as all software, needs to live on physical media. That makes them prone to “bit rot, hardware failure, and format obsolescence” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 662). The physical media are decaying and it’s getting more and more difficult to create the necessary systems to play the games.
\par
To truly study video games, they have to be played (preservation for use). At the same time, they are important audio-visual and material cultural heritage. The author’s approach tries to unify this two aspects.
\par
Video games, as all software, exist in between the physical and the digital. Software is the instruction, carved onto a physical medium, out of which a digital world can emerge.
\par
‘The cartridge or disk is a vessel with the wine, the stone upon which the writing was carved containing the deeper meaning born of words and syntax. It is the physical manifestation of code wrapped in layers of instructions that created the portable package, a world in itself containing a world within’ (Reinhard, 2018, p. 93).
\par
“Software is of two objects: the code-object and the media-object” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 661)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Code-object is code… inclusive the UI

\item 
Media-object is the media and paratextual material

\end{itemize}

\par
The author criticizes that older lists of what needs to be preserved in video games often leaves out \emph{the user}.
\par
“But focusing on such materials neglects that software needs a user; a video game emerges from the user’s interactions with the software’s rules and potentials for it to actually be, and so, the ancillary materials that enable or depend on and result from that running also need to be considered.” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 662)
\par
The problem is in preservation focused on technical aspects versus preservation for use.
\par
Ongoing processes of preservation of the media-object face many obstacles, such as all software. See “bit rot, hardware failure, and format obsolescence” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 662). The author then goes to length to describe the different problems these three aspects bring up for preservation.
\par
\subsection{“Proposed Approach: Intertextuality, Paratext, Aura, Assemblages and Articulations” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 664)}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
intertextuality: ‘meaning in a text can only ever be understood in relation to other texts; no work stands alone but is interlinked with the tradition that came before it and the context in which it is produced’ (Allen, 2000, p. i)

\item 
paratext: “formulates a simple algorithm that governs the whole of Paratexts: Paratext = peritext + epitext. The peritext includes elements ‘inside’ the confines of a bound volumeeverything between and on the covers, as it were. The epitext, then, denotes elements ‘outside’ the bound volume—public or private elements such as interviews, reviews, correspondence, diaries etc.—although Genette does comment that ‘in principle, every context serves as a paratext.’” (Koenig-Woodyard, 1999)

\end{itemize}

\par
What counts as paratext can be defined fundamentally different. From technical material, such as drivers and text files, to paraphernalia.
\par
‘there is never a single or correct way to read a text, since every reader brings with him or her different expectations, interests, viewpoints, and prior reading experiences’ (Allen, 2000,p.6–7)
\par
The author would radically include all forms of fan-labour as well. Nonetheless, paratextuality should be understood as a very fluid concept, especially when deciding what is text, and what is peripheral.
\par
“Dividing between what is in and around the game stops being useful when all of the potential influences on a game are taken into account. By being flexible in what we consider to be central and peripheral to a game, the framework proposed here opens the door to new and varied positions. Limiting the number of items considered to be part of the game does not allow for the expression of the complexity of video games and their derivative material.” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 667)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
aura: “Games are much more than entertainment; they are art, they are software, but they are also inherently social. They are represented in movies and books and are the source for a plethora of derivative material, such as clothing and toys. All of which hold on to the game’s aura.” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 667)

\end{itemize}

\par
In opposition to Benjamin, Latour and Lowe argue that copies can hold the original’s aura as well. Even if they are “copied, ported to other platforms, adapted, reinvented, and reimagined” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 667). Through this perspective, video games become assemblages.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
assemblage: “DeLanda defines assemblages as ‘wholes whose properties emerge from the interactions between parts’.” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 668)

\end{itemize}

\par
Assemblages have kinship with the concept of intertextuality. An Assemblage is fluid. It’s part can exist on their own and become parts of other or multiple assemblages.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
articulations: “defined by Slack and Wise as ‘dynamic interminglings that can move in many and various directions, propelled by various and changing circumstances (of other articulations). The “web” of these particular articulations is what [they] call an assemblage’” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 668)

\end{itemize}

\par
Articulations are parts of assemblages. They are also very flexible in being articulations.
\par
“While it could be argued that this interpretation could cause confusion in the understanding of an assemblage, making a whole too stable risks oversimplifying and denying the dynamic aspects of assemblages and their articulations.” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 669)
\par
Video games form also assemblages with the art forms that came before them and from which they are pulling.
\par
“Video games are assemblages of many different origins and the combination of arts forms, culture, and technologies. They are also social and, as a result, defined by their users. Players are parts of these assemblages. Therefore, they should be involved in the study and preservation of this medium.” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 670)
\par
\subsection{Positions on preservation}

\par
“what are game historians and preservationists aiming for, accuracy or authenticity?” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 671)
\par
“In essence, being accurate refers to an attempt to reproduce the original as closely as possible, while being authentic suggests that the meaning of the original is put forward.” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 671)
\par
“there needs to be an approach to video game preservation emphasising authenticity, meaning it acknowledges the presentness of a game and that some aspects of games cannot be saved unless compromises are made and scholars of video game preservation consider diverse materials and alternative tactics.” (Guay-Bélanger, 2022, p. 672)
\par
Notions of assemblage, intertextuality, paratextuality, and the concept of the aura can help for such an approach.},

  abstract = {How is computer history possible from the viewpoint of computer science? By considering media archaeology’s theory of operative and thus a-historical media computer archaeology combines an interdisciplinary set of theories and methods to answer this question. At first, the problems of computer historiography (technical inaccuracy, inconsistency, and idiosyncrasy) will be deconstructed with the help of history criticism, discourse archaeology, and media archaeology. Following that, technology–oriented tools and methods are gathered for describing ‘old’ computers within an ‘archaeography’ and analyzing them within a mid-range theory. Methods of computer science, electronics, diagrammatics etc. supersede hermeneutical methods of historiography. Additional tools (re-enactment, demonstration, computer philology) from media science and other disciplines complement this set of methods. Retro computing sets the frame for 4 computer archaeological projects about early micro computers (1975-85): 1. a computer philological analysis of a ‘traditional’ computer demo; 2. the development of a “Game of Life” on an 8-bit platform; 3. the development of a new computer game for a 1978 gaming console; 4. the reparation of an 8-bit computer done by a hardware hacker. These projects are discussed afterwards to gain the specific didactical modus operandi of retro computing hobbyists. Just like historical home computing (starting from the late 1970s) retro computing autodidactically gathers theoretical, historical, and practical knowledge by trial and error, gamification, and e-learning through a “learning by doing” procedure. The confrontation of three historical examples with three actual retro computing projects will prove this. The didactical reflection of retro computing projects describes a ‘retro didactic’ that would be useful for a broad application of historic sensitive, computer scientific knowledge with the help of less complex systems like early microcomputers are.},

\par
Auch wenn digital-born Artefakte, wie in diesem Fall Video Spiele, grundlegend immaterieller Natur sind, lassen sie sich nicht von ihrem materiellen, sowie dem zeitlichen und geschichtlichen Kontext trennen.
\par
Ein zweites Problem ist, dass die Wiedergabe von früheren digital-born Artefakten auf heutigen System nicht zwingendermassen zu gleichen Resultaten führt. In vielen Fällen gehen semantische und proto-semantische Informationen verloren oder werden anders wiedergegeben.
\par
Das führt zu der immerwährenden Fragen nach akkurater vs. authentischer Wiedergabe der Spiele. Die Frage ist umso interessanter, als dass es schon zu Beginn Spiele gegeben hat, welche auf verschiedenen System verschiedene Kapazitäten ausnutzen mussten, respektive grundlegend andere Ästhetiken bedienten (siehe Ikari Warriors und Axe of Rage).
\par
\subsection{4.3 Software Preservation und Emulation}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Zu Software: Kittler (1993b, 2007)

\end{itemize}

\par
Emulation ist der Versuch, ein Software für ein altes System auf einem neuen wieder abspielen können. Sie unterscheidet sich dabei von der Simulation, welche auf einem inneren Model basiert. Emulation ist ergebnissorientiert.
\par
Emulation wird immer ein Übersetzungsproblem (translation gap) haben, da sich physikalisch-elektromagnetische Prozesse nur in der Theory abstrahieren lassen. In der Wirklichkeit sind sie eng mit dem Materiellen verwoben und haben ihre eigenen particularities. Es gibt dazu auch verschiedene Grade und Schichten der Akkuratizität der Emulation eines alten Systemes.
\par
Dazu kommt, dass Emulatoren in der Regel Hobbyprojekte sind, und damit schwierig sind im Bezug auf Qualitätssicherung oder als verlächssliches Forschungswerkzeug. Dabei gilt es zwischen errors of omission, commission oder addition zu unterscheiden – Fehler durch Auslassung spezifischer Elemente des Originalsystem, durch Programmierfehler oder durch Fehler wegen neuer Funktionalitäten die im Original nicht existiertern.
\par
“Epistemische Objekte sind nach Rheinberger [2000] Forschungswerkzeuge, die selbst zum Gegenstand der Forschung werden. Dies geschieht beispielsweise dadurch, dass sie sich als defizitär oder defekt erweisen (vgl. Kap. 4.4.5). In dieser Hinsicht können die errors of omission Emulatoren in epistemische Objekte transferieren.” (Höltgen, 2020, p. 199)
\par
Bei der Emulation werden mehrere Übersetzungsgrenzen überschritten. Durch die Nähe zu linguistischen Begriffen kann hier gut auf semantische Untersuchungen zurück gegriffen werden.
\par
“Die obigen Übersetzungsprozesse ereignen sich nicht nur zwischen zwei Zeichenkategorien, sondern auch zwischen zwei ‚Übersetzern‘. Menschliche Übersetzer treten hierbei als die Programmierer (der Software des Emulators und der später zu emulierenden Software des Zielsystems, bspw. eines Spiels) auf. Maschinelle Übersetzer sind dann neben den Compilern (die den Emulator-Sourcecode für das Hostsysteme ausführbar machen) die Emulatoren selbst, die als Interpreter die historische Software in Echtzeit auf dem Hostsystem ausführen, indem sie diese als mehr oder weniger akkurate „translation“ [Tijms 2000] von der Sprache des Original- in die des Zielsystems übertragen” (Höltgen, 2020, p. 204)
\par
“Als epistemologische Tools verhelfen Emulatoren ihren Nutzern – insbesondere wenn sie über errors of addition verfügen – so eine „alien phenomenology“ zu betreiben. Dieses Konzept des US-amerikanischen Medienwissenschaftlers Ian Bogost versucht eine Perspektive auf Technologie vorzuschlagen, die jenseits einer anthropozentrischen Perspektive liegt.” (Höltgen, 2020, p. 205)
\par
Zu guter Letzt ist es wichtig Emulatoren (und Spiele) nicht nur theoretisch-analytisch zu untersuchen sondern auch durch carpentry, was soviel meint, wie selbst den Versuch zu wagen etwas zu entwickeln. Erst in diesem pragmatischen Schritt werden viele Lücken erst erkenntlich. Carpentry kann in der Design Rhetorik mit dem Schritt 4 nach dem Berner Model parallel gelesen werden.},

I have to admit that I don’t understand how the internals of the computer work in details. Even though I’m pretty comp-literate.

\item 
Do I need to investigate Assembler? I need to get an overview what kind of languages were used in our game corpus.

I was not aware of the importance of the internal clock and I’m quite fascinated by it. There is an Übersetzungsschwelle to be traversed here, since a physical clocking mechanism is bound to the laws of physics, which are hard and complex to translate into software.

Thus, an awareness of this aspect is critical to the useful analysis of games. However, this is often missing from current analyses of games. To illustrate both the significance of techno-historic limits, and several fundamental principals of digital technology, the landmark games Myst (Cyan, 1993) and Doom (id Software, 1993) are explored as examples of the evolution of game aesthetics over time. This leads to an examination of the future limits of the rendering of images and sounds, and how this may have an impact on future game aesthetics and genres.},

\section{Some Annotations\\
(5/29/2023, 4:05:14 PM)}

\par
“"Hello" and "World" have significance, just as the function name "print" has a significance that goes far beyond its instructions to the computer and gestures toward a material culture of ink and writing surfaces.” (Marino, 2012, p. 1)
\par
“While we examine programming architecture and admire modularity and efficiency, the study of computer code does not currently emphasize interpretation, the search for and production of meaning.” (Marino, 2012, p. 1)
\par
“To critique code merely for its functionality or aesthetics is to approach code with only a small portion of our analytic tools.” (Marino, 2012, p. 2)
\par
“People like to project humanity onto the computer, but is it possible that with regard to coding we do just the opposite and strip the code of its human significance, imagining that it is a sign system within which the extensive analyses of semiotic systems and signification, connotation, and denotation do not apply?” (Marino, 2012, p. 2)
\par
“While computer scientists can theorize on the most useful approaches to code, humanities scholars can help by conjecturing on the meaning of code to all those who encounter it both directly by reading it or indirectly by encountering the effects of the programs it creates. In effect, I am proposing that we can read and explicate code the way we might explicate a work of literature in a new field of inquiry that I call Critical Code Studies (CCS).” (Marino, 2012, p. 4)
\par
“"There are division and distinctions between what the code is and does," he notes. This relationship with the coding structures and their processes is what we must trace, interrogate, and map.” (Marino, 2012, p. 4)
\par
“Critical Code Studies (CCS) is an approach that applies critical hermeneutics to the interpretation of computer code, program architecture, and documentation within a sociohistorical context. CCS holds that lines of code are not value-neutral and can be analyzed” (Marino, 2012, p. 4)
\par
“using the theoretical approaches applied to other semiotic systems in addition to particular interpretive methods developed particularly for the discussions of programs.” (Marino, 2012, p. 5)
\par
“Critical Code Studies follows the work of Critical Legal Studies, in that it practitioners apply critical theory to a functional document (legal document or computer program) to explicate meaning in excess of the document's functionality, critiquing more than merely aesthetics and efficiency.” (Marino, 2012, p. 5)
\par
“Much of the current examination of code seems to revolve around efficiency, reusability, and modularity. My own critical approach will stress meaning, implication, and connotation, though not in terms of a self-contained system of meaning but with respect to the broader social contexts.” (Marino, 2012, p. 5)
\par
“CCS will require the artful combination of knowledge of programming languages and knowledge of interpretive approaches” (Marino, 2012, p. 5)
\par
“If as Wendy Hui Kyong Chun has announced, "software is ideology" we might also say computer code is ideology, yet an ideology that is doubly hidden by our illiteracy and by the very screens on which its output delights and distracts” (Marino, 2012, p. 5)
\par
“Fundamental to CCS is the assumption that code is a social, semiotic system employing grammar and rhetoric. As Rita Raley argues, "Code may in a general sense be opaque and legible only to specialists, much like a cave painting's sign system, but it has been inscribed, programmed, written. It is conditioned and concretely historical"” (Marino, 2012, p. 6)
\par
“Adrian MacKenzie writes, "Code is written and run within situated practices, with reference to particular domains, and within particular orderings and disorderings of collective life. Its forms and abstractions are attached to lives" (19). The way this sign system circulates within actor-networks of computers and machines is also the way it develops connotations worthy of interpretation.” (Marino, 2012, p. 6)
\par
“Critical Code Studies may observe some of Kittler's suggested restraint, keeping code from becoming a controlling, transcendental imaginary, but in examining code in context our approach will look towards and beyond characters to interpret gestures, performances, and possibilities” (Marino, 2012, p. 7)
\par
“What can be interpreted? Everything. The code, the documentation, the comments, the structures - all will be open to interpretation.” (Marino, 2012, p. 7)
\par
“Within the code, there will be the actual symbols but also, more broadly, procedures, structures, and gestures. There will be paradigmatic choices made in the construction of the program, methods chosen over others and connotations.” (Marino, 2012, p. 7)
\par
“In addition to symbols and characters in the program files themselves, paratextual features will also be important for informed readers. The history of the program, the author, the programming language, the genre, the funding source for the research and development (be it military, industrial, entertainment, or other), all shape meaning,” (Marino, 2012, p. 7)
\par
“The goal need not be code analysis for code's sake, but analyzing code to better understand programs and the networks of other programs and humans they interact with, organize, represent, manipulate, transform, and otherwise engage.” (Marino, 2012, p. 7)
\par
“Thus the "World" the program greets has expanded to include other programmers at computers with Internet access (qualifiers that constrain the world to an absurdly tiny portion of the Earth's population)” (Marino, 2012, p. 8)
\par
“code is not merely a means or procedure, it is a text, which is often accessible after the program has executed” (Marino, 2012, p. 8)
\par
“As Cayley notes, in these new media objects, code is not merely instrumental but rather a performative, transformative, mediating process.” (Marino, 2012, p. 9)
\par
“an interpreter could collaborate with someone who is literate in the language, building networks of literature, and coalitions of meaning building. We might consider such fluency "cyborg literacy."” (Marino, 2012, p. 9)
\par
“key to CCS is an understanding that the act of encoding is not a question of finding one correct command out of a codex of commands, but of choosing (and at times creating) a particular combination of lines to build a structure that resonates and operates aesthetically, functionally, and even conceptually with the other discourse of encoded objects as well as mathematical and natural language discourse.” (Marino, 2012, p. 9)
\par
“their reading is not limited to the performance of the code, as they also stress "more purposeful arrangements of code by the programmer," noting for example that even the visual of code is for human readers, since "the same code could be expressed in any shape or arrangement and would run the same output."” (Marino, 2012, p. 10)
\par
“Ultimately, they conclude that "All coding inevitably involves double coding. 'Good' code simultaneously specifies a mechanical process and talks about this mechanical process to a human reader"” (Marino, 2012, p. 11)
\par
“Raley interrogates the notion of a "deep structure of the code," examining the metaphors and mythologies of "code," asking, "Is code then semiotic?" (5). Throughout the essay, Raley contrasts "the discourse of the foundational architecture of code that mines the depths to produce a geology (or mythology) of surface" with "the discourse of computational code in terms of inaccessible, inscrutable processes" (2). Raley identifies "the difference of the sign system of code" as "its executability, the operative transformation of a message from one symbolic form to another" (12). Yet it is this dual state as signs and operations that offers much to the play of interpretation of code that she performs.” (Marino, 2012, p. 12)
\par
“The challenge will be to apply such readings to less intentionally artistic programs.” (Marino, 2012, p. 13)
\par
“Anxieties can arise when the operations of the computer are mystified to the extent that users lose sight of (or never know) how the software actually works, thus putting themselves at the mercy of predatory companies like Microsoft, which makes it easy (or inevitable) for users to accept at face value the metaphors the corporations spoon feeds them.” (Marino, 2012, p. 14)
\par
“This call from Hayles and others envisions a leserevolution of code, a moment when code comes to the people.” (Marino, 2012, p. 14)
\par
“At the limits of code studies are, indeed, hardware studies. As Chun points out, "Software cannot be physically separated from hardware, only ideologically" (19). At risk of ignoring "the significance of hardware and extramedial representation," CCS must at times engage” (Marino, 2012, p. 14)
\par
“with circuits and microprocessors (18).” (Marino, 2012, p. 15)
\par
“However, though my analysis said something about neighborhood hierarchies, it offered little insight on Quicksort itself, nor did it draw from Quicksort a lesson about the society from which it came. My main error was analyzing Quicksort aside from its historical, material, social context.” (Marino, 2012, p. 15)
\par
“For an algorithm such as Quicksort, the code meets the social realm at the site of its implementation and in the context of the application in which it is used. I was not engaging the cultural origins of Quicksort within the history of computation or even a particular incarnation of Quicksort in a language (I was using pseudocode). Without discussing the human context of the Quicksort code in terms of authorship, use, development, circulation, or operations, I was left with little more than a process” (Marino, 2012, p. 15)
\par
“Interpretation requires reading an object in its (post)human context through a particular critical lens. This context involves human machines operating in actor-networks. Thus, a simple looping subroutine, say, might remind one of the eternal return of the repressed, but unless that metaphor has significance with respect to the particular, material context of the script itself, the interpretation is not very significant.” (Marino, 2012, p. 15)

“Cultural critics often speak abstractly of coding practices or the processes of code without getting to the code itself. My emphasis, however, should not understate the need for interpreting these structures with an eye towards fundamental human concerns, concerning race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality; concerning the military-industrial-entertainment and academic complex; concerning surveillance and control over electronic systems-to name but a few.” (Marino, 2012, p. 15)},

  abstract = {"Critical Code Studies (CCS) names a set of methodologies for the exploration of computer source code using the hermeneutics of the humanities. Like 10 PRINT CHR\$ (205.5 + RND (1)); : GOTO 10, Mark Marino's Critical Code Studies treats code not as merely functional but as a text, one that can be read, and misinterpreted, by non-programmers. As the author notes, code's "meaning is not determined entirely by the programmer's intention but also by how it is received and recirculated. That is not to argue that code can be taken out of context or that code means whatever people say it means but rather that the meaning of code is contingent and that code is subject to the rhetorical triad of speaker, audience (both human and machine), and message." It is time to develop methods of tracing the meaning of code. Computer source code has become part of our political, legal, aesthetic, and popular discourse. Code is being read by lawyers, corporate managers, artists, pundits, reporters, and even literary scholars. Code is being used in political debate, in artistic exhibitions, in popular entertainment, and in historical accounts. As code reaches more and more readers and as programming languages and methods continue to evolve, we need to develop methods to account for the way code accrues meaning and how the readers and shifting contexts shape that meaning. We need to learn not only to understand the functioning of code but the way code signifies. We need to learn to read code critically. Critical Code Studies offers a CCS "starting kit," a set of techniques that scholars and other interested parties can use to interpret code in a non-computational context"-- Provided by publisher},

\begin{itemize}

\item 
juxtaposing two coding solutions to the same problem of randomizing an array in javascript; the first clear, simple and longer and the second short, elegant and harder to read

\item 
then going about how these two can be read completely differently by different people and contexts, outline that people even read the gender of the person behind the code, through the code

\item 
code can express identity

\item 
coders also express themselves differently depending on context or how they have been taught (socially, technically), ie which programming virtues or paradigms they adhere to

\end{itemize}

\par
“Only the surface challenge asks whether or not the human can speak in a way the computer understands. The deeper challenge asks the programmers to communicate who they are to other humans, as coworkers and collaborators, through their use of code. Their code is not so much a litmus test, proving whether they can perform the task, as it is an essay exam, communicating character through process, values, and approaches to challenging questions.” (Marino, 2020, p. 7)

\item 
code is actually much more unstable and uncertain then the material world; it’s not math, it’s culture

in-game photography as a good example of the three rule-fiction relations by Juul

\item 
2.2 Videogames as cybertexts

cybertexts are a textual category of media; are non-linear, becoming linear through the act of reading

\end{itemize}

«[W]hen you read from a cybertext, you are constantly reminded of inaccessible strategies and paths not taken, voices not heard. Each decision will make some parts of the text more, and others less, accessible, and you may never know the exact results of your choices; that is, exactly what you missed.» (Aarseth 1997: 3)

After Flusser: photography is real, not the world or the photographic apparatus

\item

\item 
game worlds are not made to tells stories, but to make them experienceable

\par
Videogames are such complex cybertexts, that a player hardly ever experiences or sees the same as any other player. In-game photographer now take a curated snapshot, sometimes far from the path-to-take, and frame it contextually. As such, they are similar to archicture-photographies.

  abstract = {This article takes inspiration from Youtuber and software developer ‘SethBling’ and his 2016 ‘code-injection’ (Bling, 2016), in which, using only a standard Super Nintendo Entertainment System controller and in-depth knowledge of the console, he ‘injected’ and executed the code of popular mobile game Flappy Bird (Nguyen, 2013) into a running instance of Super Mario World (Miyamoto, 1990), effectively transforming one game into another through play. Drawing from this I propose a performative understanding of videogames (and software in general) to reinvigorate discussions of software’s materiality. Though it is possible to contrast Wendy Chun’s (2008a) suggestion that one can view software as ‘vaporous’ against Friedrich Kittler’s (1995) assertion that ‘there is no software’, I propose a more holistic approach. Academics and users alike should attempt to see software as living a double-life: as simultaneously solid as it is (metaphorically) gaseous. It then becomes possible to embrace software(s) as performative examples of the entangled ‘phenomena’, suggested by Barad (2007), that produce everyday reality through quantum activity. I explore SethBling’s codeinjection suggesting that actions clearly reveal software’s double existence as both tangible ‘thing’, locatable on magnetic memory, and as a vaporous non-entity. Accepting these propositions together, software can be understood as continuously reemerging through shared activities. Following Barad, I conclude that this quality is not unique to software, but software – and videogames above all – are a useful tool for understanding a vision of reality that favours activity over materiality as the basis of our existence.},

  abstract = {This project is driven by omissions at the intersection of ecological game studies and media-ecology. Although authors have studied videogames from a variety of ecological approaches, few have attempted to develop a holistic methodology, embracing videogames' specific attributes while recognising their role within larger physical systems. This thesis is an attempt to address this, reading videogames as simultaneously about and functioning as ecologies. My methodology draws on the agential-realist philosophy of Karen Barad whose theory of 'intra-activity' is abundant with ecological ramifications. Adapting Barad's 'intra-active' framework for use with contemporary videogames, I read them as assemblages of hardware, software and their human players. I explore three significant aspects of game studies: interaction, aesthetics and affect. Focusing on interaction, I analyse the game Shelter.   Emphasising the role of hardware and software, I read these processes in conjunction with an understanding of gameplay. This encourages a shift away from seeing gameplay as 'interaction' as it is defined within human-computer-interaction, and instead promotes a view that is 'intra-active'. Siding with Barad, play is radically reframed as a phenomenon that produces the apparent objects of its inception. In the second study I approach a series of more experimental games illustrating how an agential-realist worldview influences aesthetics. Analysing high-concept puzzle games Superhot,  Antichamber,  and Manifold Garden,  I suggest that these games place a focus on aspects of ecology often over-shadowed in so-called 'natural' imaginings of our world, such as time, space and their entanglement.  Finally, bringing my focus to the role of the player in my ecological understanding of games I analyse a number of short, human-centred or biographical games. Seeing the role of the player in an ecological manner, designers deviate from traditional methods of generating pathos and affect. Rather than developing empathetic relationships between player and avatar through immersion, viewing the player as only a part of an ecological system demands a posthuman response from players. These designers ask players to empathise while acknowledging their role is small and not central. This thesis presents a novel point of view that draws attention to the ambitious design practices of artists while suggesting new avenues in the future.},

Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) is a popular phenomenological approach combining richly detailed personal accounts with theory-driven interpretation to investigate lived experiences and contextualised meaning-making. Although it is applicable to a diverse range of experiences and has become a dominant qualitative approach in many disciplines, IPA has not been utilised as extensively in game studies. In this article, I outline IPA as a methodology with the potential to offer valuable insights for game studies. I draw on health research, where IPA is most prevalent, and a case study from my research comparing Campbell's hero's journey against player experiences in Breath of the Wild and Ocarina of Time to explain IPA's theoretical foundations, history, methods, strengths and weaknesses. I argue that IPA offers game studies a useful methodology for exploring the complexity, diversity, multiplicity and situatedness of practices and meanings around games.}

\subsection{1}

\par
Images are culture and representation, but also material and affective. Vision is our ability to see, whereas visuality or scopic regime is how our vision is formed or constructed. Ocularcentrism describes our simping for visual culture. Simulacra are images detached from a relation to the real world.
\par
Visual economy is about how visual objects travers cultures, forcefully or not, meanwhile changing their meanings, contexts, affects etc.
\par
it’s important to reflect on the power relations embedded in images and their media, and what they enable us to see or not see.
\par
\textbf{What do images represent, how do they affect and what power relations are they transposing?}
\par
Five important aspects in engaging with visual culture
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item 
visualising social difference

\item 
how images are looked at

\item 
Differentiating visual cultures

\item 
the circulation of images

\item 
The agency of images

\end{enumerate}

\par
“an image may have its own visual effects; these effects, through the ways of seeing mobilised by the image, are crucial in the production and reproduction of visions of social difference; but these effects always intersect with the social context of viewing, with how the image is circulated, and with the visualities spectators bring to their viewing.” p. 22
\par
a critical approach to interpreting visual images:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
take images seriously

\item 
think amour about the social conditions and effects of images and their modes of distribution

\item 
~consider your own way of looking at images

\end{itemize}

\subsection{2}

\par
Four sites of thinking about visual material
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
production

\item 
content

\item 
circulation

\item 
audiencing

\end{itemize}

\par
Three modalities of a site
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
technological

\item 
compositional

\item 
social (economical, social, political)

\end{itemize}

\par
Notes on figure 2.2: the womanooks at one image that we can’t see. She seems to be saying something to a man, even explaining, closely standing by. She makes a hand gesture. The man in turn looks at a painting of nude woman. In the background, a ceinturerie denotes the street is in a french speaking country. Three more people can be seen in the slightly blurry background. The photograph is black and white and could date back to something around 1900 - 1920.
\par
Images of the same gerne share certain features. It seems that genre regarding images is much easier then in game studies. Remediation is the referencing of older genre while gestating a new one. Images often fit clearly into one genre, while ~relating to others at the same time.
\par
\textbf{Auteur theory}: what did the images author had in mind at production?
\par
Compositionality: how the image‘s content is arranged
\par
Aura: the authority, authenticity and unattainability of an umage
\par
Audiencing: the process of witnessing, renegotiating or rejecting the meaning of an image, by particular audiences in particular circumstances
\par
Convergence: from medium-specific visual content to transmediality, communication interdependence, many ways of accessing media content, melange between top-down corporate comm and bottom-up participatory culture
\par
\subsection{3}

\par
Is about how to read this book. There are three main approaches: reading by sites and modalities, by visual material at hand, and by relation to other books.
\par
\subsection{4 The Good Eye - compositional interpretation}

\par
\emph{the image itself, compositional, video games (films and fine arts)}
\par
The Good Eye involves becoming a \textbf{connoisseur} of what one is looking at, acquiring a certain expertise. Compositional interpretation (CI) needs a lot of context information in order to have this expertise at hand. CI does neglects the social sites of an image and needs to be paired with other methods, such as semiotics or discourse analysis. CI is close to phenomenological approaches. \emph{It can be a good starting point to other, more critical inquiries.}
\par
CI can take production into account, if it relates to how the image looks like it does.
\par
Michael Nitsche discusses \textbf{functionality} as something that influences how a game looks and feels like. Looking at the rules that define functionality can be important in CI in video games.
\par
Compositionality is built up from the following characteristics
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 

\par
Content
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
take time to make sure you know what you are seeing

\item 
often defines Genre

\end{itemize}

\item 

\par
Colour
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
hue (the actual colour), saturation (its purity) and value (light- and darkness)

\end{itemize}

\item 

\par
Spatial organisation
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
perspective (geometrical), logic of figuration (position offered to a viewer by the image), focalisers (visual organisation)

\end{itemize}

\item 
Montage (Film)

\item 
Sound

\item 
Light

\item 
Expressive content

\end{itemize}

\par
As of 2016, Gillian Rose knows of only two sampling strategies to analyse visual material from video games: screenshots and clips, both manually initiated (see chapter 5 for more on sampling strategies).
\par
\subsubsection{Further keywords regarding film}

\par
mise-en-scène, screen ratio, screen frame, screen planes, multiple images, superimpositions, shot distance, focus, angle, point of view. Regarding camera movement there is pan, tilt, roll, tracking shot, crane shot and zoom shot.
\par
\subsubsection{Expressive content (mood, feel, atmosphere, vibes)}

\begin{quotation}

\par
the combined effect of subject matter and visual form (Taylor (1957)
\par
\end{quotation}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
accessible through, for example, imaginative writing

\item 
Nitsche uses the term presentation to refer to expressive content in video games

\item 
another approach here is radical formalism (mimeticism, haptic)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{5 Content and cultural analysis}

\par
CCA is about analysis large sets of images through sets of rules and procedures concerning selection, coding and quantitative analysis.It thus has an inherent relationship to mass media, also, originating from that corner of visual culture.
\par
Lev Manovich recently developed an approach called cultural analytics. CCA doesn’t necessarily exclude qualitative analysis. It enables the researcher to look at visual material at different scales, sometimes making out patterns for example. Therefor it is important to concentrate on two aspects in particular: \textbf{replicability and validity}. CCA tries to be methodological explizit and reflective by avoiding sampling bias. On the downside, CCA focuses mostly on the compositional modality of images and says little about production and the social.
\par
\subsubsection{Stages of CCA}

\par
This approach is based on counting clearly defined visual elements on a clearly defined corpus of images, and then analyse the frequency of those elements.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 

\par
Finding images: the set of images needs to be representative towards the research questions
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Sampling strategies include: random, stratified (from subsets), systematic (ie interval), cluster (random groups)

\item 
Sampling size depends on variation in the image set; the more variation the bigger the set

\end{itemize}

\item 

\par
Devising your categories for coding
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Codes/categories must be exhaustive, exclusive, enlightening (Slater, 1998). They must be developed in relation to their theoretical concerns, and must have analytical significance, pointing towards the relation between images and cultural context. This is the \textbf{validity}.

\end{itemize}

\item 

\par
Coding the images
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Codes must be as unambiguous as possible. That should theoretically enable different researchers at different times to code the same images the same way. This is \textbf{replicability}. Codes need testing and reworking before being put into their final forms, as well as be well documented.

\end{itemize}

\item 

\par
Analysing the results
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
frequency, relationality to between different codes, emerging of themes

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\par
Cultural analytics is more software based and works on a more compositional level (colors, forms, etc), less on meaning and signification.
\par
\begin{quotation}

\par
Numbers do not easily translate into significance.
\par
\end{quotation}

\subsection{6 Semiology (social semiotics) - Laying bare the prejudices}

\par
…is about how images make meanings. It has close ties to the social sciences. One of the most important aspects of semiology is … wait for it … the “sign”. It has an elaborate vocabulary and sets of categories on how we make sense of images and how they produce meaning. Semiology claims to be scientific, through unearthing inequalities (as opposed to ideology, which is knowledge constructed to hide inequalities). This shows the social sciences (Marx) influences on semiology, and hence it is concerned with social effects of meaning.
\par
That said, of late the terminology “ideological complex” is used in order to denote that semiological approaches are not necessarily objective (Althusserian science) but also a form of ideology since they have their own distinct interests and resistance against another social group. This approach can lead way to more reflectivity in working semiologicly.~
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Semiology often focuses on the site of the image itself, as the place where meaning resides and has a good look at the compositional as well as social modality.~

\item 
A good amount of semiologic approaches focus on the social modality at the other sites, ie audiencing, giving way to \textbf{social semiotics}.

\end{itemize}

\par
Social semiotics concentrates on the act of doing meanings, instead of the sign/the meaning itself. On the downside, semiology is heavily theoretical loaded and uses a distinct analytical vocabulary, which makes it a very elaborate and work-intensive methodology.~
\par
\subsection{8 Discourse Analysis 1 - Text, intertextuality and context}

\par
Concentrates on how texts are involved in the construction of social difference, hence, concentrates on power relations and their politics. One of this methods main intellectual is Michel Foucault. He saw discourse as a form of discipline, hence the focus on power.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
discourse: groups of statements that structure the way a thing is thought, and the way we act on the basis of that thinking

\item 
intertextuality: the meaning of a text depends on a meaning of another text

\item 
discursive formation: how meanings in a particular discourse are linked together

\item 
power: is not only applied top down, but is present everywhere, as there is discourse everywhere

\item 
power/knowledge constitute each other

\item 
regimes of truth: knowledge is power because it defines what is true

\end{itemize}

\par
Discourse produces the world as it understands it. Foucault said that painting “is discursive practice that is embodied in techniques and effects”. That said, he was rejecting methodological and theoretical analysis and focused mainly on how the power in question works.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
How do images construct accounts of the social world? The discourse analyst focus is on the image itself and its social modality.

\item 
“In particular, discourse analysis explores how those specific views or accounts are constructed as real or truthful or natural through particular regimes of truth”

\item 

\par
iconography shares some approaches with discourse analysis, especially intertextuality: how were symbols and signs understood by their contemporary audience. Panofsky differentiated three ways of interpretation.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
primary, natural, pre-iconographic

\item 
secondary, conventional, iconographic

\item 
intrinsic, symbolic, iconological

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{How to discourse analysis 1}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
sources are eclectic and intertextual: look for “coherent pattern of statements across a range of archives and sites”

\item 
after the establishing some of the more obvious sources, start to widen. this can be time-consuming and one of the difficulties is to know, when to stop gathering sources

\item 
Cowling: look and state commonalities in the different texts

\item 
look at your sources with fresh eyes, forget all preconceptions

\item 
immerse yourself in the sources; read and re-read them again and again, look carefully

\item 
identify key themes

\item 
how do these produce their effects of truth; look for processes of persuasion (works that try to establish truth dominance, ie “scientific” studies)

\item 
also look at complexity and contradictions within a given discourse; also called interpretative repertoire

\item 
last but not least, look for invisibility; that which is not seen or said

\item 
read your sources with great care for detail

\end{itemize}

\par
An important aspect is to find the institutional location of a discourse, to locate the social site from where particular statements are made, what social authority authors of a statement have.
\par
\subsubsection{How to be reflexive}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
acknowledge the choices made, open up your work to other readings, be aware of the engagements of your own works with others

\item 
use detailed evidence to support arguments

\item 
coherence towards the discourse, the analysis, the study itself in relation to previous research

\item 
examine deviations to the studied discourse

\item 
acknowledge your own, and your institution’s, part in the study

\end{itemize}},

In the present article, this system is combined with the method of rhetorical design analysis after the Bernese model. Using a Lego set as an example, it is demonstrated how designers apply rhetorical techniques to achieve affects and how these function. Furthermore, it is explained how the emotions of adult Lego fans are prompted and influenced by building the (and playing with the) Lego Star Wars AT-AT Walker \#4483 model.

\par
“Medien zielen auf Wirkungen ab: Filme, Bücher, Bilder, Spielzeuge wollen unterhal­ ten, informieren, bewegen – sie werden verwendet und benutzt, in Aktion versetzt, gelesen und gefühlt. Diese Absicht zur Wirkung, die Wirkungsintentionalität, prägt auch die Rhetorik. Medien haben damit also immer auch eine rhetorische Funktion, und die Gestaltung dieser rhetorischen Funktion ist Teil ihres Designs. Die rhetori­ sche Designanalyse setzt hier an: Sie untersucht die rhetorischen Prinzipien in gestal­ teten Artefakten (wie Broschüren, Fotos, Sounds, etc.) auf ihre Wirkung hin.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 109)
\par
“Design (im engeren Sinne also Grafikdesign, Servicedesign und Produktdesign) lässt sich als wirkungsintentionale Kommunikation verstehen, in der sich eine Rhetor­Funktion mit bestimmten Zielen an verschiedene Adressaten wendet. Bewusst ist hier von einer Rhetor­Funktion die Rede und nicht vom Rhetor, da die tatsächlichen Designer/innen natürlich auch abwei­ chende Zielvorstellungen gehabt haben können. Es ist der Nachvollzug der Wirkme­ chanismen im Designobjekt, der mehr oder weniger plausible Absichten nahelegt, die durch die Designanalyse bestätigt oder verworfen werden können. Interessant ist hierbei, dass im Design stets unterschiedliche Wirkziele gleichzeitig aktiv sind, die sich sowohl ergänzen als auch einander widersprechen können. Solche Zielkonflikte geben oft wichtige Hinweise auf die rhetorische Funktionsweise des Designs.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 110)
\par
“Grund­ sätzlich jedoch geht die rhetorische Designanalyse davon aus, dass der empirische, tatsächliche Gestalter nicht unbedingt bewusst Kenntnisse über Wirkziele, Medien und Techniken haben muss – was insbesondere in der Analyse von Amateurdesign eine Rolle spielt, aber auch in jenen Bereichen hilfreich ist, die von mehreren Gestal­ ter/innen verantwortet werden, wie etwa Filme.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 111)
\par
“Die in diesen Arbeitsschritten vollzogenen Perspektivwechsel von der Rezeptions­ in die Produktionsperspektive und zurück entsprechen strukturell (wie an anderer Stelle gezeigt)3 den Lernprozessen der Klassischen Rhetorik.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 111)
\par
“Die beteiligten Expert/innen betreiben die Analyse des Objekts aufgrund eigener Arbeits­ erfahrungen und im Nachvollzug üblicher Techniken der Gestaltung. Es leuchtet daher auch ein, dass dieses Verfahren insbesondere zur Beurteilung zeitgenössischer Designartefakte geeignet ist, da in diesen Objekten der Orts­ und Zeitbezug des gestal­ terischen Wissens näher an der Analysesituation liegt, als dies bei historischen Ana­ lysen der Fall wäre.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 111)
\par
“Im zweiten und dritten Schritt, in dem die verschiedenen Wirkziele erfasst und miteinander verglichen werden, hat sich bewährt, die aufmerksame Betrachtung des Artefakts um eine reflektierte Nutzung zu ergänzen; hier nehmen die beteiligten Expert/innen also die Rolle von möglichen Adressat/innen des Objekts, von Usern, ein.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 112)
\par
“Sein Aufsatz Declaration by Design ... erschien erstmals 1985 im Journal Design Issues und verbindet die eher allgemeine Frage nach dem heuristischen Potenzial der Rhetorik für das Design mit einem konkreten methodischen Vorschlag. Ein besonde­ res Augenmerk legt er dabei zum einen auf die Rolle der Technologie und ihrer Vertre­ ter (der Technologen) als Designer” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 112)
\par
“Das technologische Argument wird hierbei als Ausdruck des Logos verstanden, in dem technische Bedingungen und menschliche Bedürfnisse vernunftgeleitet in einer Designlösung zusammenfänden.9 Das zweite Element, bei Buchanan »der Charak­ ter oder das Ethos«, wird als Reflektion des Designers durch das Produkt verstan­ den: »Designer geben Objekten eine Stimme und verleihen ihnen persönliche Eigen­ schaften, von denen sie annehmen, dass sie bei den Nutzern Vertrauen wecken, und zwar ganz unabhängig davon, ob das technologische Argument stichhaltig ist oder nicht.«10 Drittens schließlich definiert Buchanan als letztes Element des Design­ Arguments »die Emotion oder das Pathos«11 als die emotionale Seite eines Designs. In Bezug auf die Nachbardisziplinen des Designs stellt Buchanan diese drei Elemente als ›Brücken des Austauschs‹ vor, wobei der Logos den Kontakt zu den Natur­ und Sozialwissenschaften, der Ethos zur Ethik und Politik und das Pathos die Verbindung des Designs zur Kunst und zur Ästhetik herstelle.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 113)
\par
“aus seinem Kontext und seinen Nutzungsszenarien heraus rhetorisch deuten” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 113)
\par
“Dieses Set führt neben 14 Minifigures (bei 779 Teilen) zudem strategisch geschickt zusätzlich auch einige neuartige Steine ein, wie etwa den gelben ›2x2x3 [73º]‹, der in der Fortifikationsmauer der Burg eine tragende Funktion übernimmt und noch eine Rolle in der Fallstudie spielen wird (Abb. 4).” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 115)
\par
“Bei all diesen genannten Kommunikationsmaßnahmen sind dezidiert Erwachsene selbst die Ziel­ gruppe, und der Aspekt der Nostalgie spielt dabei eine besondere Rolle: Es wird an die Erinnerung appelliert, die das Kindheitserlebnis mit früheren Lego­Modellen mit den heutigen Inhalten von Lego verknüpft.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 119)
\par
“Das Lego­Modell AT­AT Walker 4483 aus dem Jahr 2003 steht also in einem Kontext des Umbruchs: mitten in einer Reaktualisierung eines Populärmythos und der Neu­ erfindung einer Spielzeugmarke, ein hybrides Wesen zwischen ›Spielzeug für Kinder‹ und ›Ausstellungsstück für erwachsene Sammler‹, ein Signifikant konkreter filmi­ scher Spielhandlungen und Reminiszenz zugleich, ein doppeltes Objekt der Nostalgie und seiner Aktualisierung.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 120)
\par
“Ich werde jedoch vorerst das Modell 4483 als Designobjekt selbst auf seine rheto­ rische Verfasstheit hin befragen. Hierfür müssen wir die Kriterien der Designherme­ neutik bestimmen, die einen solchen Blick auf die Funktionalitäten leiten (also die Kriterien der Analyse). Ich schlage vor, dies über eine Kombination von zwei Perspek­ tiven zu tun: indem die möglichen Nutzungsszenarien des Designs mit seinem Kontext abgeglichen werden.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 120)
\par
“Man kann hieraus eine Reihe rhetorischer Wirkziele der Nutzung des Designobjekts ›AT­AT Walker‹ ableiten, die sich im Übrigen auch mit Nutzungsszenarien auf Fotogra­ fien von den Websites einschlägiger Fanforen belegen lassen: Das erste Großmodell von 2003 dient dem Sammeln und dem Nachstellen von Filmszenen in der Totale, das zweite dient dem Spiel und kann auch eine Brücke zur dialogischen Filmhandlung schlagen, das dritte dient dem dynamisierten Spiel, das sich eher nicht am Filmvor­ bild, sondern an den »Clone Wars« orientiert und sich also an ein jüngeres Publikum richtet, und das vierte bietet von allem etwas.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 122)
\par
“Erste These, zum Logos: Die gelbe Farbe des Legosteins ›2x2x3 [73º]‹ unterstützt die Orientierung beim Zusammenbauen.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 124)
\par
“Zweite These, zum Ethos: Der oder die Entwickler des Lego­Modells sind gleich­ zeitig Star Wars­ und Lego­Fans und verknüpfen (unbewusst?) zwei zentrale Erzäh­ lungen der jeweiligen ›Mythen‹ miteinander: das Innere des AT­AT und die gelbe Lego­Ritterburg.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 124)
\par
“Dritte These, zum Pathos: Der Stein ist eine (unbeabsichtigte?) Anspielung, die bei den erwachsenen Nutzer/innen eine angenehme Erinnerung wecken kann.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 125)
\par
“Die von Buchanan beschriebene Unterteilung in drei Elemente des Design­Arguments ist in seinem Sinne als methodologischer Rahmen verwendbar. Meines Erachtens bedarf sein Einsatz im Rahmen der rhetorischen Designanalyse jedoch einer Ergänzung: Es sollte stets deutlich gemacht werden, woher die Kriterien der Design­Analyse stammen, auf welchen hermeneutischen Ansatz man sich bezieht.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 126)
\par
“Der oben vorgestellte Ansatz plädiert für eine Lesart eng am Objekt, sozusagen ein funktionales ›Close reading‹, das die unterschiedlichen Nutzungsszenarien vonein­ ander trennt und im Zusammenspiel mit dem Kontext des Objekts für die Analyse und Interpretation zugänglich macht.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 126)
\par
“Im Zentrum dieser Betrachtung stehen die Wirkungen. Eine solche ›enge‹ Lesart der Wirkungsintentionen kann helfen, den kulturwissenschaftlich geprägten Blick auf das Design zu ergänzen, der oft eher nach Bedeutungen als nach Wirkungen fragt.” (Scheuermann, 2017, p. 126)

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Many of the ways in which artifacts appear to or actually do affect us—as elegant, dynamic, comfortable, authentic—are based on the fact that they are designed objects. Design is an effect-oriented process that resorts to design rules linking formal aspects of designed artifacts to specific design effects. Design rhetoric tries to capture these links between design techniques and resulting effects. This article presents design-rhetorical methods of identifying design rules of intersubjective validity. The new approach, developed at Bern University of the Arts, combines rhetorical design analysis with practice-oriented design research, based on the creation and empirical testing of design variants in accordance with effect hypotheses.},
  note = {“His concept of “design argument” puts forward the idea that even industrial design objects such as lamps, bookshelves, or coffee machines incorporate quasi-rhetorical modes of influence. According to Buchanan, the impact on viewers and users is exerted by the technological (logos), characteristic (ethos), or emotional (pathos) features of designed objects.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 334)
\par
\subsection{Design Rhetorics nach dem Berner Model}

\begin{enumerate}

\item 
Effekte von Design Artefakten können analysiert werden, indem Design als rhetorischer Process verstanden wird

\item 
Es gibt kein Effekt-freies oder nicht-rhetorisches Design

\item 
Die drei rhetorischen Dimensionen logos, ethos und pathos könne eingesetzt werden, um drei Kategorien visueller Effekte zu definieren. Design-Artefakte beeinflussen uns auf rationeller/funktionelle Ebene (logos), verkörpern einen spezifischen Charakter oder beeinflussen unsere Werte (ethos) und stimulieren unsere Emotionen (pathos).

\item 
Die Beziehung zwischen formalen Mitteln und deren visuellen (haptischen, etc) Effekten kann in Design-Regeln beschrieben werden.

\item 
Das decorum oder aptum bennent das überliegende rhetorische Prinzip, welches den Möglichkeitsraum der Abweichungen von den Regeln umschreibt.

\end{enumerate}

\par
There is an interesting bit on the methodology. After a theoretical analysis, variants of a design were produced to test the different effects.
\par
“The design rules were explored and determined by a rhetorical design analysis of existing graphic artifacts. After theoretical analysis, a practice-based research method was developed and applied. The validity of the design rules was tested by first creating graphic design variants according to specific design rules and by then examining the actual effects of the designed objects on observers.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 338)

\subsection{“How to Determine the Effects of Designed Objects?” (Schneller, 2015, p. 339)}

\par
“A major difficulty of rhetorical-design analysis is the determination of the actual effects of design artifacts.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 339)
\par
Weil Effekte dermassen variabel und Kontext-abhängig sind, muss sicher gestellt werden, dass nicht einfach irgend etwas zugeschrieben wird.
\par
“In the first project, a triangulation of researchers was used to eliminate individual bias in effect ascription; every design artifact was analyzed independently by several members of the project team.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 341)
\par
Ein weiterer Ansatz sind die Speedometer Scales.
\par
(Schneller, 2015, p. 342)
\par
Hier verschwinden die individuellen Biase nicht, sondern sind gleichzeitig mit einer Konvergenz aller Eindrücke dargestellt.
\par
\subsection{Decorum}

\par
“From a design-rhetorical point of view, the character and strength of the generated effect depend on the decorum, that is, whether the design seems appropriate to the beholder in a given context.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 343)
\par
Die Frage ist als nicht nur, wie wirkt das Design auf dich, sondern weiterhin, stimmt der Effekt für dich in der gegebenen Situation?
\par
\subsection{Source Triangulation}

\par
Es ist nicht immer ganz einfach festzustellen ob Effekte formal und direkt entstehen oder indirekt durch Gestaltungsregeln. Für dieses Problem wurde eine Source Triangulation eingesetzt.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Das gestaltete Objekt

\item 
Experten-Interviews

\item 
Design Manuals

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Rules}

\par
Es ist zwar äusser schwierig, Gestaltungsregeln zwischen Effekten und formalen Elementen zu definieren, aber:
\par
“Nevertheless, there seem to be—and indeed need to be for graphic design and visual rhetoric to actually work—general means-effect relationships that can be stated in design rules.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 347)
\par
Es kam wieder Triangulation von Quellen und Forschenden zum Einsatz.
\par
\subsection{Practice-based Research}

\par
Um die Effekt-Hypothesen zu überprüfen, wurden Design-Artefakte hergestellt und getestet. Die Leitfrage dabei war: Können visuelle Effekt bewusst generiert werden, indem Gestaltungsregeln angewendet werden? Welche Kontexte forcieren oder verzerren den gewünschten Effekt?
\par
“On the whole, however, the adopted method of practice-based design research proved to be a powerful heuristic for the rule-based generation and testing of design effects.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 352)},

  abstract = {Semiotics (also called semiotic studies) is the systematic study of sign processes (semiosis) and meaning making. Semiosis is any activity, conduct, or process that involves signs, where a sign is defined as anything that communicates something, usually called a meaning, to the sign's interpreter. The meaning can be intentional, such as a word uttered with a specific meaning; or unintentional, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can also communicate feelings (which are usually not considered meanings) and may communicate internally (through thought itself) or through any of the senses: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or gustatory (taste). Contemporary semiotics is a branch of science that studies meaning-making and various types of knowledge.The semiotic tradition explores the study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications. Unlike linguistics, semiotics also studies non-linguistic sign systems. Semiotics includes the study of signs and sign processes, indication, designation, likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is frequently seen as having important anthropological and sociological dimensions; for example the Italian semiotician and novelist Umberto Eco proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication. Some semioticians focus on the logical dimensions of the science, however. They examine areas also belonging to the life sciences—such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to, their semiotic niche in the world (see semiosis). Fundamental semiotic theories take signs or sign systems as their object of study; applied semiotics analyzes cultures and cultural artifacts according to the ways they construct meaning through their being signs. The communication of information in living organisms is covered in biosemiotics (including zoosemiotics and phytosemiotics). Semiotics is not to be confused with the Saussurean tradition called semiology, which is a subset of semiotics.},

The little square model is simply incorrect. It harms. It gets in the way. If you find yourself thinking that a pixel is a little square, please read this paper. I will have succeeded if you at least understand that you are using the model and why it is permissible in your case to do so (is it?). Everything I say about little squares and pixels in the 2D case applies equally well to little cubes and voxels in 3D. The generalization is straightforward, so I won’t mention it from hereon1. I discuss why the little square model continues to dominate our collective minds. I show why it is wrong in general. I show when it is appropriate to use a little square in the context of a pixel. I propose a discrete to continuous mapping—because this is where the problem arises—that always works and does not assume too much.},

\par
A pixel is a point in space rather then a little square. An image is then reconstructed from point samples, using different reconstruction filters. On of the poorest of these is the box filter. This on just applies a box to a point sample.
\par
“When one “magnifies” or “zooms in on” an image in most popular applications, each pixel appears to be a little square. The higher the magnification or the closer in the zoom, the bigger the little squares get. Since I am apparently magnifying the pixel, it must be a little square, right? No, this is a false perception. What is happening when you zoom in is this: Each point sample is being replicated MxM times, for magnification factor M.” (Smith, p. 7)

A study of indie video game developers examines how the video game as agencement is composed of technical and narrative elements, and how the subject-formation process of the developer is bound up with the creation of video games.

Diese sind für die Untersuchung der komplexen, oft durch digitale Medien und Netzmedien vermittelten Text-Bild- Video-Kombinationen allerdings oft noch wenig geeignet. Diskursanalytische Ansätze bieten allerdings die Möglichkeit, diese Forschung weiterzuentwickeln. Im Aufsatz wird zunächst der Stand der diskursanalytischen Diskussion um den Status der Bilder rekapituliert, um dann drei Ebenen einer visuellen Diskursanalyse vorzustellen: Fokussierte Hermeneutiken, Analyse der Grammatisierungen und eine Untersuchung diskursiver Prozesse. Abschließend wird argumentiert, dass dieser Zugang besonders für die Untersuchung der Bildverwendung in kommunikativ angelegten Medienverhältnissen angelegt ist. Schlagwörter: Visuelle Diskursanalyse, Bildhermeneutik, digitale Medien, Kommunikation, Informationsgesellschaft In recent years, different methodologies and methods of visual analyses have been developed in the social sciences. However, these methods are often not well suited for researching complex mediated combinations of text, image and video. Methodologies of discourse analysis offer the opportunity to further develop visual sociology. Three levels of a visual discourse analysis are discussed: focussed hermeneutics, analysis of grammatisations, and the study of discursive processes. In the conclusion, it is argued that this approach is especially useful for the study of images in media conditions which foster communicative practices.

Rather, few scholars have investigated how an analysis of the source code can inform a hermeneutic reading of the game. In this paper I will present a reading of the source code of Passage (Rohrer, 2007), argue for why a focus on authorial intention is unnecessary when investigating the symbolism and metaphors of a game, and illustrate how the whitebox analysis can inform the formal analysis of the executed game. Finally, I shall discuss how the source code relates to the game as a ‘work’, and how it can be used for studies of symbolism and metaphors. Thus I will conclude that it is indeed a valuable method for game studies, albeit needing more studies on the textual relation between executed game and source code.},

\textbf{White-box testing} (also known as \textbf{clear box testing}, \textbf{glass box testing}, \textbf{transparent box testing}, and \textbf{structural testing}) is a method of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing}{software testing} that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing}{black-box testing}).

\item 
white-box testing is a necessary part of a \emph{complete} analysis of a game, but not necessarily a necessary one

\item 
only few have attempted to do a hermeneutic reading of a game’s source code and most of them based their analysis on a notion of internationality and authorship

\item 
these notions of authorial intent have been critiqued as a fallacy

“if the game manages to communicate what the author intended, there should be no need for studying this intention. If the game fails in doing so, the researcher must go outside the game” (Willumsen, 2016, p. 2)

\item 
in games it is often not possible to pinpoint a single author (even less so a nationality)

the author intents to show that source code can be interpreted without authorial paratexts, and avoid intentional fallacy

\item 
there is a large chunk of highly relevant writting that I’ll just include here

\par
“Naming can be seen as a part of the code aesthetics, and can therefore be studied in relation to program comprehension, however in the following analysis, I will search to make sense of method and variable names as parts of a formal analysis of video games. My argument is that much meaning can be interpreted from the code itself, and that much of this meaning may not be immediately evident in the executed game. As such, some of the things that are usually interpreted on an abstract and symbolic level in the traditional game analysis will be hardcoded into the game’s source code through naming. I believe that this allows us to disregard author statements and other secondary sources in which the programmers and/or creators express their intent and meaning of the game, and instead uncover this meaning simply through an analysis of the code.” (Willumsen, 2016, p. 5)
\par
“As with any other game example, large parts of Passage’s code are not relevant for this investigation. The few lines that are useful for the analysis have been found by playing through the game, interpreting symbolism and metaphors, and returning to the code to see if any of this is spelled out in the code.” (Willumsen, 2016, p. 5)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
those two paragraphs point to method and how to approach cirtical code analysis in video games research

\item 
the naming of variables and functions ~offers clear pointer to things that might be ambiguous in the executed game (ie the player becoming a gravestone, meaning death, but in the sourcecode it is clearly written that the player is dead)

\item 
reading gender and relationship stereotyping form source code!

\begin{enumerate}

\item 
reading into the source code can add to understand metaphors and symbols that are ambiguous. “Moreover, it enforces a focus on games as second order design – that which is designed by an author is not the executed game but the source code.” (Willumsen, 2016, p. 8)

\item 
reading structures that are present but not visible in the game

\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
source code is a different “text” then the executed game; it can be several hypo- or paratexts (code, comments) to the main text, the executed game

“Neither hypotext, cybertext, nor paratext may be the right ways to make sense of the relationship between the game and its code, and hence what status the source code should have in the formal analysis.” (Willumsen, 2016, p. 9)

leaving with an open question on authorship in video games

\end{itemize}

“Moreover, in order to justify how white-box analysis can avoid the intentional fallacy, we must study in depth whether game designers and programmers can be understood as heuristic authors, whether we have to accept the author as an individual, at least for cases where the game is made by one person, or if there is a third, advantageous way of conceptualizing (the) author(s) of video games.” (Willumsen, 2016, p. 9)},

  abstract = {"The number of publications dealing with video game studies has exploded over the course of the last decade, but the field has not yet produced a comprehensive reference work. The Routledge Companion to Video Game Studies, by well-known video game scholars Mark Wolf and Bernard Perron, aims to address the on-going theoretical and methodological development of game studies, providing students, scholars, and game designers with a definitive look at contemporary video game studies. Features include: -comprehensive and interdisciplinary models and approaches for analyzing video games; -new perspectives on video games both as art form and cultural phenomenon; -explorations of technical and creative dimensions of video games; -accounts of the economical, political, social, and cultural dynamics of video games"--},

\par
“An emulator is an application that tries to mimic another system in order to run applications the way they were run on their original system. It” (“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 49)
\par
Where as “Virtualization \textbf{relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system}.” (VMWare)
\par
“emulators can only load an image of the game and do not necessarily preserve accurately other aspects of the game itself: its graphical aspects, sound precision, controllers, and original playing context.” (“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 49)
\par
That said, it is sometimes/often the only way to have access to the actual game, while also changing the gameplay experience actively.
\par
“Video game history should not only be a project of preservation, but also one of contextualization.” (“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 49)
\par
\subsubsection{Some notes on faithful rendition of games}

\par
“But emulation changes the gaming experience in different ways, whether because of the player’s hardware or the emulator’s lack of precision itself. For instance, different screens render graphics in different ways. A 1980s NTSC TV set is not as precise as a 2010s DEL screen. The cathode-ray tubes of home TV sets and arcade cabinets give a blurry quality to the graphics that masks “imperfections” in the final render (Therrien, 2012, p. 15). In terms of preservation, a sharp-edged pixel is not faithful to what a common player experienced in the 1980s. Even pixel aspect ratios are different from one screen type to another. Moreover, the GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin can upscale the original resolution up to 1080p, which of course is not faithful to the original conception.” (“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 50)
\par
It would be interesting to know, how this changes the experience of a game.
\par
“This goal of precision is often central for some emulator projects. For those behind the MAME project, playing the game is considered merely a “nice side effect” (MAME, n.d.) from their objectives. Sure, you have to actually play the games to see if the emulation worked; but making games easily playable (on a modern PC) is not a specific goal they pursue.” (“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 50)
\par
That playability could not be the main goal didn’t occur to me…
\par
“Air Strike Patrol (Opus, 1994), for example, an isometric shooting game for the SNES, there is a shadow drawn under the aircraft the player controls. Since it is difficult to render, it will not show up with a common emulator (ZSnes or Snes9X, for example)—and the typical player will not know that it should have been there.” (“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 51)
\par
This changes a lot!
\par
“An accurate emulation should in theory restore these imperfections in the final render, but it is not always the case. You will never know if an obscure game you load within an emulator is correctly rendered, if you don’t have the real functionality of the original hardware.” (“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 51)
\par
\subsubsection{Some notes on contextualizing gameplay}

\par
“Even the simple ambience of a console in a 1980s living room on a small TV set is not the same as a researcher’s office computer screen.” (“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 51)
\par
“Emulation can’t revive MUDs (multi-user dimensions) or MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing games) communities when they disappear.” (“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 51)
\par
\subsubsection{Accessibility}

\par
Although emulation is though of giving access to old games, it can be quite daunting and difficult to create the right setup to play a game. Given you’ll have the game files and are ready to dabble in some legal grey zone.
\par
\subsubsection{A new Layer of Contextualization}

\par
“Emulation is not a preservation of every aspect of an apparatus, but it is still a convenient and accessible way to have an experience analogous to the one on the original system. This “second-hand” experience requires scholars to be aware of the technical and cultural differences between the two systems.” (“The routledge companion to video game studies”, 2014, p. 53)
\par
Conclusion: Emulation can make gameplay accessible, but it will also change it. It is thus important to be reflective of that and to contextualize it and not use it as the sole source of analyzing a game.},

  abstract = {Atmospheres are everywhere: at the workplace, in the soccer stadium, in front of the crackling fireplace. They shape our everyday language and have become quite natural expressions of how we find ourselves in certain environments and how we feel about them. Their influence is far-reaching: aesthetic atmospheres are closely linked to a contemporary experience-oriented historical culture whose products and practices claim to establish an immediate contact with the past. With ›Vergangenheitsatmosphären‹ Felix Zimmermann offers for the first time a term to adequately describe this striving for immediacy. By means of in-depth analyses of the digital games »Anno 1800« (2019), »Assassin's Creed Syndicate« (2015), and »Dishonored: The Mask of Wrath« (2012), the term is contoured and the productivity of atmospheric research trained on theories and methods of public history, game studies, and phenomenology is demonstrated.},
