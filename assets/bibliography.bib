It is the end product of a three-year research project conducted by the INTEGRAE team, and is divided into three parts. Part 1 contextualizes the research on graphics and visuality within game studies, notably through the opposition between fiction and rules and the difficulties in finding common vocabulary to discuss key visual concepts such as perspective and point of view. Part 2 discusses a number of visual traditions through which we frame video game graphics (film, animation, art history, graphical projection and technical drawing), highlighting their relevance and shortcomings in addressing the long history of video games and the very different paradigms of 2D and 3D graphics. Part 3 presents the Game FAVR, a model that allows any game’s visual representation to be described and discussed through a common frame and vocabulary. The framework is presented in an accessible manner and is organized as a toolkit, with sample case studies, templates, and a flowchart for using the FAVR provided as an annex, so that researchers and students can immediately start using it.},

Both - Are broadly applicable across subject matters - concern the particular and the probable - require invention and judgment, and - involve arrangement in space and time From ancient times through the Renaissance, rhetoric was a key element in education, and its methods were widely adapted to other arts, including design. Rhetoric's loss of status in modern times is explained, and its resurgence in the latter part of the 20th century is described through the works of three scholars that focus on the relationship between rhetoric and design. The conceptualization of these scholars is best represented in the view that rhetoric is design limited to words and design is rhetoric with an unlimited palette.},

While previous scholarship tends to examine the aesthetics of video game as a homogenous, self-contained genre that can be clearly defined and understood within the framework of a variety of dichotomies, thinking of video game through the lens of the Denkbild allows us to understand the diversity, conditionality, and incommensurability of game as a multimedia aesthetic object. By presenting two snapshots of video game players, the collector and the glitcher, this paper argues that the concept of Denkbild allows us to better understand the relationships between game, gamers, and the socio-political context in terms of unexpected bonds, accidental breakthroughs, and moments of absolute freedom.},

  abstract = {Critical code studies (CCS) is an emerging academic subfield, related to software studies, digital humanities, cultural studies, computer science, human–computer interface, and the do-it-yourself maker culture. Its primary focus is on the cultural significance of computer code, without excluding or focusing solely upon the code's functional purpose. According to Mark C. Marino, it is an approach that applies critical hermeneutics to the interpretation of computer code, program architecture, and documentation within a socio-historical context. CCS holds that lines of code are not value-neutral and can be analyzed using the theoretical approaches applied to other semiotic systems in addition to particular interpretive methods developed particularly for the discussions of programs. As introduced by Marino, critical code studies was initially a method by which scholars "can read and explicate code the way we might explicate a work of literature", but the concept also draws upon Espen Aarseth's conception of a cybertext as a "mechanical device for the production and consumption of verbal signs", arguing that in order to understand a digital artifact we must also understand the constraints and capabilities of the authoring tools used by the creator of the artifact, as well as the memory storage and interface required for the user to experience the digital artifact. Evidence that critical code studies has gained momentum since 2006 include an article by Matthew Kirschenbaum in The Chronicle of Higher Education, CCS sessions at the Modern Language Association in 2011 that were "packed" with attendees, several academic conferences devoted wholly to critical code studies, and a book devoted to the explication of a single line of computer code, titled 10 PRINT CHR\$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10.},

  abstract = {The applied research in Games employs numerous instruments to carry out its investigations. The search for scientifically based analysis demands strategies that are in line with expectations regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of their studies. The intrinsic heterogeneity of games also requires that the mode of research be opportunely flexible and straightforward, to cover a greater diversity of elements. Such convergence in diversity can occur through the standard set of playful impulses of language, ritual, and myth; and its relations with the natural signal aspects of the games: interface, mechanics and narrative. Considering these specific characteristics of the games focusing on their experiences provided through the signs created, specific experimental research procedures can be applied as a possibility of research methodology. In this sense, Semiotics, as a study on systems and phenomena of signification, has the appropriate attributes to be used in the scientific research of games endowed with the mentioned aspects. Several kinds of research on Games have already been made through Semiotics, but there is no description of procedures for its application, allowing Semiotics to be adopted in a schematic way of studying these contexts. For this reason, it is proposed a fundamental methodology that enables the use of Semiotics as research structured in Games considering its intrinsic characteristics of signification and experimentation. The definition of the method is based on the correlation between the categories Primeity, Secundity and Terceirity of Semiotics articulated with the interface, mechanics, and narrative of the research object, that is, the Game. In support of the theoretical rationale of the proposal, a summary methodology guide will support researchers in their application. Associating Semiotics with Games in a structured model allows for the logical cohesion of study and analysis activities, generating uniform results, but respecting the specificities of signs and experiences of each Game. To confirm the proposal, it will be applied in Study Cases with analog and digital games, demonstrating its organization, application, and flexibility of adoption.},

Denson analyzes works ranging from the Transformers series and Blade Runner 2049 to videogames and multimedia installations to show how what he calls discorrelated images—images that do not correlate with the abilities and limits of human perception—produce new subjectivities, affects, and potentials for perception and action. Denson's theorization suggests that new media theory and its focus on technological development must now be inseparable from film and cinema theory. There's more at stake in understanding discorrelated images, Denson contends, than just a reshaping of cinema, the development of new technical imaging processes, and the evolution of film and media studies: discorrelated images herald a transformation of subjectivity itself and are essential to our ability to comprehend nonhuman agency.},

He claims that today’s greatest emergency is that we fail to notice other emergencies in society. To break out of this state, we need an aesthetic force to shock individuals into a new awareness. Unfortunately, while many social and global issues have recently come to widespread attention, the emergency still prevails in many forms of media. For example, the emergency in AAA video games appears in their continual push for higher resolution graphics, hyper-detail, verisimilitude, and intricate gameplay, perpetuating a hegemonic ideology. Exploitative labor practices, lack of representation beyond hetero-sexual, cis-gendered and neurotypical, and capitalist ideals are perpetuated in popular games in service of a hyper-real, high-fidelity aesthetic. One force that combats this emergency is pixel graphics and simplified gameplay, or post-retro aesthetics. While tied to the past, these aesthetics are not nostalgic but transgressively hauntological. To explore this claim, I discuss Dys4ia and Undertale as key post-retro games and reach beyond commercial indie gaming to point to hauntological work being done through DIY game making platformers such as Bitsy.},

Such an expanded terrain requires an expanded ethnographic approach and also a grounded rethinking of what images (the key tools at our disposal) are, mean and do. Images today embrace a new role as multimodal, multi-sensory and multi-perspectival producers of relations, of material, spatial and temporal engagements with the world that surrounds them. Indirectly commenting upon the papers that make up this special issue, the present paper aims to offer some theoretical and methodological guidelines on how to address, understand and use the terrain of contemporary digital visual practices.},

Until recently, spectating has remained an analytical domain of film theory and visual arts. In game studies, this perspective has changed, with the arrival of the phenomenon of gameplay spectating and game streaming on a mass scale, and its leakage into academic as well as popular consciousness. How does the spectacle change the analytical perspective towards video games as objects of scholarly analysis and video gaming as reflective practice? In this paper, I will approach the video game as an algorithmic spectacle and propose an analytical perspective to study this phenomenon, reaching out to theories of moving (digital) image proposed by the philosopher Vilém Flusser and the filmmaker Harun Farocki.},

His analysis casts light on how media-practical research forged common epistemic cause in programs that stretched from 1930s interwar computing at MIT and eugenics to the proliferation of seminars and laboratories in 1960s Paris. This mobilization ushered forth new fields of study such as structural anthropology, family therapy, and literary semiology while forming enduring intellectual affinities between the humanities and informatics. With Code, Geoghegan offers a new history of French theory and the digital humanities as transcontinental and political endeavors linking interwar colonial ethnography in Dutch Bali to French sciences in the throes of Cold War-era decolonization and modernization.},

  abstract = {How is computer history possible from the viewpoint of computer science? By considering media archaeology’s theory of operative and thus a-historical media computer archaeology combines an interdisciplinary set of theories and methods to answer this question. At first, the problems of computer historiography (technical inaccuracy, inconsistency, and idiosyncrasy) will be deconstructed with the help of history criticism, discourse archaeology, and media archaeology. Following that, technology–oriented tools and methods are gathered for describing ‘old’ computers within an ‘archaeography’ and analyzing them within a mid-range theory. Methods of computer science, electronics, diagrammatics etc. supersede hermeneutical methods of historiography. Additional tools (re-enactment, demonstration, computer philology) from media science and other disciplines complement this set of methods. Retro computing sets the frame for 4 computer archaeological projects about early micro computers (1975-85): 1. a computer philological analysis of a ‘traditional’ computer demo; 2. the development of a “Game of Life” on an 8-bit platform; 3. the development of a new computer game for a 1978 gaming console; 4. the reparation of an 8-bit computer done by a hardware hacker. These projects are discussed afterwards to gain the specific didactical modus operandi of retro computing hobbyists. Just like historical home computing (starting from the late 1970s) retro computing autodidactically gathers theoretical, historical, and practical knowledge by trial and error, gamification, and e-learning through a “learning by doing” procedure. The confrontation of three historical examples with three actual retro computing projects will prove this. The didactical reflection of retro computing projects describes a ‘retro didactic’ that would be useful for a broad application of historic sensitive, computer scientific knowledge with the help of less complex systems like early microcomputers are.},

Thus, an awareness of this aspect is critical to the useful analysis of games. However, this is often missing from current analyses of games. To illustrate both the significance of techno-historic limits, and several fundamental principals of digital technology, the landmark games Myst (Cyan, 1993) and Doom (id Software, 1993) are explored as examples of the evolution of game aesthetics over time. This leads to an examination of the future limits of the rendering of images and sounds, and how this may have an impact on future game aesthetics and genres.},

The article traces these three strands, focusing on how they demonstrate a heightening of the stakes in game studies research by providing access to scale and connecting digital games research to wider interdisciplinary contexts.},

  abstract = {The Game and Interactive Software Scholarship Toolkit (GISST) is a suite of tools aimed at helping support and create new forms of game studies and software studies scholarship. Digital games scholars generally analyze game objects using ad-hoc methods: some games are emulated and others are recorded as video or screenshots, and scholars rarely explicitly de ne their methodologies for working with game software (or performances employing that software) or reference games in standardized ways. GISST supports game scholars by providing for the creation, reference and management of games (as executable data), game performances (as video) and game states (as frozen run-time memory from a suite of supported emulators). GISST can ingest a variety of game studiesrelated resources and reproduce them as Web documents through its CiteState.js JavaScript library. GISST is a rst step in a new methodology focused on the creation of support applications for work in game studies, software studies and game history.},

The method is based on seven different layers of the computer game: hardware, program code, functionality, game play, meaning, referentiality, and socio-culture. Each of these layers may be analysed individually, but an entire analysis of any computer game must be analysed from every angle. Thereby we are analysing both technical, aesthetic and socio-cultural perspectives.},

Like 10 PRINT CHR\$ (205.5 + RND (1)); : GOTO 10, Mark Marino's Critical Code Studies treats code not as merely functional but as a text, one that can be read, and misinterpreted, by non-programmers. As the author notes, code's "meaning is not determined entirely by the programmer's intention but also by how it is received and recirculated. That is not to argue that code can be taken out of context or that code means whatever people say it means but rather that the meaning of code is contingent and that code is subject to the rhetorical triad of speaker, audience (both human and machine), and message." It is time to develop methods of tracing the meaning of code. Computer source code has become part of our political, legal, aesthetic, and popular discourse. Code is being read by lawyers, corporate managers, artists, pundits, reporters, and even literary scholars. Code is being used in political debate, in artistic exhibitions, in popular entertainment, and in historical accounts. As code reaches more and more readers and as programming languages and methods continue to evolve, we need to develop methods to account for the way code accrues meaning and how the readers and shifting contexts shape that meaning. We need to learn not only to understand the functioning of code but the way code signifies. We need to learn to read code critically. Critical Code Studies offers a CCS "starting kit," a set of techniques that scholars and other interested parties can use to interpret code in a non-computational context"-- Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {This article takes inspiration from Youtuber and software developer ‘SethBling’ and his 2016 ‘code-injection’ (Bling, 2016), in which, using only a standard Super Nintendo Entertainment System controller and in-depth knowledge of the console, he ‘injected’ and executed the code of popular mobile game Flappy Bird (Nguyen, 2013) into a running instance of Super Mario World (Miyamoto, 1990), effectively transforming one game into another through play. Drawing from this I propose a performative understanding of videogames (and software in general) to reinvigorate discussions of software's materiality. Though it is possible to contrast Wendy Chun's (2008a) suggestion that one can view software as ‘vaporous’ against Friedrich Kittler's (1995) assertion that ‘there is no software’, I propose a more holistic approach. Academics and users alike should attempt to see software as living a double-life: as simultaneously solid as it is (metaphorically) gaseous. It then becomes possible to embrace software(s) as performative examples of the entangled ‘phenomena’, suggested by Barad (2007), that produce everyday reality through quantum activity. I explore SethBling's code-injection suggesting that actions clearly reveal software's double existence as both tangible ‘thing’, locatable on magnetic memory, and as a vaporous non-entity. Accepting these propositions together, software can be understood as continuously re-emerging through shared activities. Following Barad, I conclude that this quality is not unique to software, but software – and videogames above all – are a useful tool for understanding a vision of reality that favours activity over materiality as the basis of our existence.},

  abstract = {Phenomenological approaches have been used in game studies, from investigations of a specific cohort's experiences with a specific game to ontological discussions of games and gameplay. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) is a popular phenomenological approach combining richly detailed personal accounts with theory-driven interpretation to investigate lived experiences and contextualised meaning-making. Although it is applicable to a diverse range of experiences and has become a dominant qualitative approach in many disciplines, IPA has not been utilised as extensively in game studies. In this article, I outline IPA as a methodology with the potential to offer valuable insights for game studies. I draw on health research, where IPA is most prevalent, and a case study from my research comparing Campbell's hero's journey against player experiences in Breath of the Wild and Ocarina of Time to explain IPA's theoretical foundations, history, methods, strengths and weaknesses. I argue that IPA offers game studies a useful methodology for exploring the complexity, diversity, multiplicity and situatedness of practices and meanings around games.}

Most research on speedrunning emphasizes its metagaming or documentary function. However, speedrunning also changes the aesthetic experience of gameplay, both for players and in spectated performance. Aesthetic investigation informed by art historical perspectives, such as Angela Ndalianis’ theory of the Neo-Baroque and H.S. Becker’s study of Art World formations, offers new insights into the experience of speedrunning and how discontinuous and disjointed simulated space is experienced and appreciated as aesthetic phenomena by players and spectators. While Nidalianis has applied her theory to videogames, among other types of contemporary entertainment, further investigating speedrunning performances through this lens extends her analysis and problematizes the idea of a videogame as a singular aesthetic work, instead drawing attention to alternative aesthetic experiences videogames can offer.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Many of the ways in which artifacts appear to or actually do affect us—as elegant, dynamic, comfortable, authentic—are based on the fact that they are designed objects. Design is an effect-oriented process that resorts to design rules linking formal aspects of designed artifacts to specific design effects. Design rhetoric tries to capture these links between design techniques and resulting effects. This article presents design-rhetorical methods of identifying design rules of intersubjective validity. The new approach, developed at Bern University of the Arts, combines rhetorical design analysis with practice-oriented design research, based on the creation and empirical testing of design variants in accordance with effect hypotheses.},

  abstract = {Semiotics (also called semiotic studies) is the systematic study of sign processes (semiosis) and meaning making. Semiosis is any activity, conduct, or process that involves signs, where a sign is defined as anything that communicates something, usually called a meaning, to the sign's interpreter. The meaning can be intentional, such as a word uttered with a specific meaning; or unintentional, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can also communicate feelings (which are usually not considered meanings) and may communicate internally (through thought itself) or through any of the senses: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or gustatory (taste). Contemporary semiotics is a branch of science that studies meaning-making and various types of knowledge.The semiotic tradition explores the study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications. Unlike linguistics, semiotics also studies non-linguistic sign systems. Semiotics includes the study of signs and sign processes, indication, designation, likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is frequently seen as having important anthropological and sociological dimensions; for example the Italian semiotician and novelist Umberto Eco proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication. Some semioticians focus on the logical dimensions of the science, however. They examine areas also belonging to the life sciences—such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to, their semiotic niche in the world (see semiosis). Fundamental semiotic theories take signs or sign systems as their object of study; applied semiotics analyzes cultures and cultural artifacts according to the ways they construct meaning through their being signs. The communication of information in living organisms is covered in biosemiotics (including zoosemiotics and phytosemiotics). Semiotics is not to be confused with the Saussurean tradition called semiology, which is a subset of semiotics.},

  abstract = {My purpose here is to, once and for all, rid the world of the misconception that a pixel is a little geometric square. This is not a religious issue. This is an issue that strikes right at the root of correct image (sprite) computing and the ability to correctly integrate (converge) the discrete and the continuous. The little square model is simply incorrect. It harms. It gets in the way. If you find yourself thinking that a pixel is a little square, please read this paper. I will have succeeded if you at least understand that you are using the model and why it is permissible in your case to do so (is it?). Everything I say about little squares and pixels in the 2D case applies equally well to little cubes and voxels in 3D. The generalization is straightforward, so I won’t mention it from hereon1. I discuss why the little square model continues to dominate our collective minds. I show why it is wrong in general. I show when it is appropriate to use a little square in the context of a pixel. I propose a discrete to continuous mapping—because this is where the problem arises—that always works and does not assume too much.},

A study of indie video game developers examines how the video game as agencement is composed of technical and narrative elements, and how the subject-formation process of the developer is bound up with the creation of video games. That is, indie video game developers are part of the creative work to develop new digital artefacts that per se are relational and composite in nature, as premised by the concept of agencement.},

  abstract = {In den vergangenen Jahren wurden in den Sozialwissenschaften im deutschsprachigen Kontext verschiedene Methodologien und Methoden visueller Analysen entwickelt. Diese sind für die Untersuchung der komplexen, oft durch digitale Medien und Netzmedien vermittelten Text-Bild- Video-Kombinationen allerdings oft noch wenig geeignet. Diskursanalytische Ansätze bieten allerdings die Möglichkeit, diese Forschung weiterzuentwickeln. Im Aufsatz wird zunächst der Stand der diskursanalytischen Diskussion um den Status der Bilder rekapituliert, um dann drei Ebenen einer visuellen Diskursanalyse vorzustellen: Fokussierte Hermeneutiken, Analyse der Grammatisierungen und eine Untersuchung diskursiver Prozesse. Abschließend wird argumentiert, dass dieser Zugang besonders für die Untersuchung der Bildverwendung in kommunikativ angelegten Medienverhältnissen angelegt ist. Schlagwörter: Visuelle Diskursanalyse, Bildhermeneutik, digitale Medien, Kommunikation, Informationsgesellschaft In recent years, different methodologies and methods of visual analyses have been developed in the social sciences. However, these methods are often not well suited for researching complex mediated combinations of text, image and video. Methodologies of discourse analysis offer the opportunity to further develop visual sociology. Three levels of a visual discourse analysis are discussed: focussed hermeneutics, analysis of grammatisations, and the study of discursive processes. In the conclusion, it is argued that this approach is especially useful for the study of images in media conditions which foster communicative practices.

Finally, I shall discuss how the source code relates to the game as a ‘work’, and how it can be used for studies of symbolism and metaphors. Thus I will conclude that it is indeed a valuable method for game studies, albeit needing more studies on the textual relation between executed game and source code.},
