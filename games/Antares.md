# Antares

## Play Notes
It's a hot mess. Getting into the game wasn't that easy. There is a very brief manual online, which explains the the things one can do. A key point was to disable the keyboard to joystick mapping. Antares is depending on the arrow keys of the keyboard to move around.

The developers had a certain kind of humor, which certainly doesn't holp up ethically in 2023. Besides that the game seems to be made with a lot of love. As in Monkey Island, a lot of dialog is just for the laughs, such as when you want to cook som sausage as an ethereal being. It just creates a messâ€¦
