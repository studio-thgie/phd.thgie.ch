# Ball Raider
I've collected all the visual material I could find under https://www.are.na/adrian-demleitner/ball-raider.

## Playing Notes
- Two version
	- cracked Robtek distro with intro (group HQC from Munich); has Diamond Game, distributed by Robtek logo on startscreen
	- (assuming) Preview distro under the name Golden Gate Software (changed to golden gate crew in Robtek distro)
- Greeted by a screen with a figure holding up a ball. Reminds me of Dolph Lundgren's character in Master of the Universe
- Credit screen, opacity oscilating red font on black
	- produced by The Golden Gate crew
	- written by Heinz Luem
	- graphics by [Orlando Petermann](notes/Orlando%20Petermann.md)
	- (c) 1997 Robtek
- Game is hardly playable, the ball is a bright green color and breaks brutaly with the redish artwork in the background. Level 1 not solved after several attempts. The input is keyboard only and clunky. The interaction of the ball with the paddle seems random and not very accurate.
- Screen to enter name for scores. Text only.
- Figure from startscreen is seens again, this time opening the highscore-table with the pulling of a thread from the top. Short and funny animation: The figure opens his eyes widly, probably to simulate astonishement at the "great" score.
- Level 1: Monster with tongue attacking person.
- Level 2: Astronaut watching arriving ship with rising moon in background. paddle and ball colors change, have better contrast now to artwork in background
- Level 3: ghost of methusalem in triangle, framed by red. Paddle and ball colors change again, seems like a thing
- The preview version plays slighty easier; ball is slightly slower, but interaction of ball with env. seems even simpler. no written feedbacks on powerups.
