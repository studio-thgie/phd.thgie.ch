### Semantic elements
- The backgrounds and the title screen are the most meaningful elements regarding a narrative. They all pertain to a sci-fi hero story. The start screen introduces a barbarian with sword, according to fantasy tropes of the time (80ies). The game backgrounds often show the same character, a space captain, in different situations: personal fighting, intergalatic action, space travel. One shows the captain rescuing a half-naked woman, a classic damsel in distress situation. Two of the backgrounds are difficult to related: a noble alien, looking down on us while holding a staff and a space-wizzard, floating in space surrounded by spheres.
- Some of the backgrounds have clear references to fantasy or sci-fi elements and characters of the time: Spaceship Death Blossom from The Last Startfighter, Dolf Lundgren as He-Man in Masters of the Universe, style and clothing from the TV series V.
