## Play Notes
I screamed of joy. What a fantastic game. It has a very hollistic UI, everything does something, and everything seems to fit together. The game is aesthetically very close to[ F-Zero for the SNES from 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Zero_(video_game)), although the race tracks there were flat. I didn't get to far on my first plays as I didn't understand all the elements yet. But it was nonetheless a joy.

The Amiga version was ported from Atari ST. The porting team [added a new intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZqoEipRP78). More information on the process can be found on the website from [Christian Haller](actants/Christian%20Haller.md).
