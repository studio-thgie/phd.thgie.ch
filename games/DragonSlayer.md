# DragonSlayer

- Found via thread https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=102400

## Setup
> When running from hard drive I noticed that it needs about 800KB Chip and 2300KB Fast RAM.  
> So, you need to add more RAM; say "4MB Fast" to be safe and then all is good ![](https://eab.abime.net/images/smilies/tongue.gif "Stick Out Tongue")
> So, set 8MB Chip RAM and now I see the "Ape" stage followed by another "Dragon" stage:

## Controls
<F1> = Sword  
<F2> = Axe  
<F3> = Bow & Arrow  
<F7> = Normal game speed  
<F8> = Slow game speed  
<F9> = Extremely slow game speed  
<F10> = Fall backwards

> In the game press the <Left Mouse Button> to skip to the next stage; so you'll be able to see more ![](https://eab.abime.net/images/smilies/wink.gif "Wink")
> Discovered another thing... if on the monster stages and you press <Space Bar>, it will generate a circle; which I assume is like a temporary shield.
