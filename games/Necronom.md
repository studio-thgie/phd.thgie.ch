## Journal
### 2023-11-28
- Michael Tschöggl is probably an interesting lead to interview, since he worked on graphics.
- There is a whole lot of design going on, but not very specified what it means (design, additional design, intro programming, alien wave design, and graphics)
- I prepared a small corpus of images to analyse with Gilles through a Auslegeordnung. I choose the HOL screenshots and produced additional ones from the intro and the ending to have some typography and paratextual in-game material. I'd love to have a collection of all bosses.
