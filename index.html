        <p>I assume a hitherto invisible rift between the research on
        the image of the video game and its material base. The image of
        video games brings with its own specificities. The constituted
        image, visible on the screen, is being born from the hardware’s
        calculation. It is interactive and as such holds within itself a
        plurality of different futures, actualizing itself upon the
        player’s input. Research on the image of video games more often
        than not focuses either on the constituted and visible image, or
        it’s material basis – either on visuality or technology.</p>
        <p>Following my assumption is the thesis that there is an
        unacknowledged interplay between the techno-historic limits of
        video game development and the reception of the image,
        respectfully, the generation of meaning for the player. Working
        on this research question demands an interdisciplinary approach
        that can handle both domains, technology and visuality, halves
        of a proposed whole. The methods used in this approach are lent
        from digital humanities, design research and new materialism
        with a focus on technology studies.</p>
